    <string name="Could_You_Have_Period_and_Be_Pregnant_content"><![CDATA[The short answer? No. But … you could have bleeding! <br><br>

You see, a period is what happens when your body sheds the lining of the uterus that it built up in the first half of your cycle. If you got pregnant, the lining would have been ready to support a baby. If you don\’t get pregnant, the lining clears out, and the process starts over the next cycle. <br><br>

But here\’s the thing: It is possible to experience some bleeding that\’s not a period when you\’re pregnant. <br>
<br><b>OK, I\’m confused. What else could cause bleeding?</b><br><br>
If you are pregnant, it\’s possible to have what\’s called "implantation bleeding" when the developing embryo implants into the lining of the uterus. And, to make things more confusing, it often happens around the time your period would be due. <br><br>
<b>So how can I tell the difference? </b><br> <br>
Implantation bleeding is light - just a little
spotting - compared to a full-blown period.
You might only notice it when you wipe, and it might be more pink or rust brown than red. You might also notice some of the other early signs of pregnancy (though not everyone does!).

If your period should have arrived but you\’ve only had some spotting, and there\’s a chance you could be pregnant, your best bet is to take a pregnancy test to get a straight answer. <br><br>
<b>What if I\’ve had heavier bleeding? </b><br> <br>
If you don\’t think it\’s your period because the timing is off or you have reason to believe you\’re pregnant (or have had a positive pregnancy test), it\’s possible you\’ve had a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy
- the one that\’s not inside the uterus and is a medical emergency. <br><br>

Other signs to watch for that could indicate
miscarriage - an early pregnancy that has not survived and is shedding - include cramping and pain in your lower abdomen and discharge of fluid/tissue. In the case of an ectopic pregnancy: pain in your lower abdomen, possibly on one side; discomfort when you go to the bathroom; brown watery discharge; and maybe even pain in the tip of your shoulder. <br><br>

If you think you could be experiencing one of these, don\’t delay a visit to a clinic to get
checked out and get treatment, if needed, to avoid any potential complications.

    <string name="Negative_Result_Am_I_Definitely_Not_Pregnant_content"><![CDATA[If a baby isn\’t on your wishlist - right now or
ever - then getting a negative pregnancy test result can be a major relief. But the doubt might still creep in. Am I sick from stress or ... ? Did I definitely pee on the stick? (We hear you, it\’s hard to see what\’s going on down there!) How accurate even is the test?

<br><br>On the flipside, if the idea of being pregnant
gave you an unexpected jolt of joy, you\’l
probably have all the same questions - while hoping for a different outcome.

<br><br>Either way, take a breath - we\’ve got the
answers...
<br><br><b>Just how reliable is a home pregnancy test?</b><br><br>
Assuming it\’s from a legit brand, pretty
reliable - about 97-99 percent accurate, to be precise. But there are some caveats.

<br><br>First, just a quick bit of science: Pregnancy
tests detect the hormone human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG), which can start to be
produced after a fertilized egg has implanted in the womb (usually 8-10 days after ovulation). So a positive result is pretty much guaranteed to be accurate.

<br><br>But when it comes to a negative result, things aren\’t quite so straightforward. If you test too early - or don\’t follow the instructions - it\’s possible to get a false negative, meaning the test says you\’re not pregnant, when in reality you are. (Side note: Some medicines - such as infertility drugs
- can create a false positive result. But of course, that\’s only relevant to some people).
<br><br><b>OK, so when\’s the right time to test? <br><br></b>
It depends on the test (sorry!). Some super
sensitive ones can be used starting as soon as eight days after conception. The packaging on these tests will shout about this feature - but read the label closely because how early you use the test can affect its accuracy.

<br><br>Otherwise, most tests are designed to be taken after the first day of a missed period. If you\’re not 100 percent sure when your period is due, the official advice is to wait 14-21 days after you last had unprotected sex before testing.

<br><br>That feels like a long time to be left hanging, but it\’s way better to get a reliable result so you know where you stand.
<br><br><b>How do I know if I\’ve done the test right? <br><br></b>
The key is to follow the instructions carefully granted, this isn\’t easy if you\’re feeling on edge. But even if you\’ve taken a test before and especially if you\’ve used a different brand - read the directions before you start because different tests work differently.

<br><br>Things to watch for are how long to hold/dip the test in your pee (some tests involve peeing directly onto the stick, others involve collecting it in a container and dunking the test in); how long you should wait before checking the result; and making sure you know how to read the results (it can honestly be a bit confusing). Oh, and make sure the test hasn\’t expired

<br><br>More handy tricks? Try taking the test first
thing when you wake up. If you are pregnant, hG levels will normally be higher the first time you go to the bathroom - and first morning urine is more concentrated, which helps with earlier detection. Putting the pregnancy test on top of the toilet can help you remember to take it if you\’re still sleepy.
<br><br><b>What if my test is negative but I still feel <br><br></b>
pregnant?
You know your body better than anyone. Keep in mind that quite a few early symptoms of pregnancy can also be signs that your period is around the corner - sore breasts, tiredness, and changes in appetite.

<br><br>But if you feel "different" and think you might be pregnant, wait a few days and test again. If you still get a negative, but your period hasn\’t arrived, speak to your doctor. They might do a urine test or a blood test to double check your at-home result.

<br><br>It\’s also important to remember there are lots of reasons other than pregnancy for a period to be late, including stress, sudden weight loss, and hormonal imbalance, which is a fairly common condition that affects how the ovaries work. So a checkup is a wise move anyway to rule out any cause for concern.

Contraception Your Doctor
Wants You to Know</string>
    <string name="_6_Things_About_Emergency_Contraception_Your_Doctor_Wants_You_to_Know_content"><![CDATA[When you\’re in the midst of a pregnancy scare, your first thought might be to turn to
emergency contraception. But is it going to
help? Do you know all the options? Here\’s what your doctor wishes you knew.
<br><br><b>1) It won\’t work if you\’re already pregnant<br><br></b>
Let\’s be straight up from the start
emergency contraception (EC) prevents a
pregnancy before it happens. There are
different types of EC, and they work by either stopping your body from releasing an egg; stopping the egg from being fertilized; or stopping it from implanting in your womb. (You can discuss your options with a doctor or at a sexual health clinic or pharmacy).
<br><br><b>2) The IUD is the most effective option<br><br></b>
If you think EC = a pill, think again. The copper intrauterine device (better known as the IUD or coil), is actually the most reliable option - it reduces the risk of pregnancy by up to 99.9 percent. And you can have it inserted up to five days after unprotected sex and it\’ll still offer protection against pregnancy. As an added bonus, once it\’s in, you can use it as contraception for up to 10 years.
<br><br><b>3) The sooner you act, the better<br><br></b>
If an emergency contraceptive pill is the best option for you, you\’ll need to take it within three or five days of having unprotected sex, depending on which type you take. There are two kinds, which have different brand names depending on where you live. But both types have one thing in common: The earlier you take it, the more effective it is.
<br><br><b>4) You shouldn\’t rely on the emergency pill <br><br></b>
as contraception
It\’s less effective than regular contraception
long term. Plus, it can have some unpleasant side effects (including headaches, tummy pain, vomiting, and irregular bleeding in the coming weeks or month), so it\’s not something you want to use regularly. If you\’re no stranger to pregnancy scares, it might be time to figure out a form of contraception that actually works for you. Schedule an appointment to discuss your options to help spare you stress in the future.
<br><br><b>5) If you throw up after the emergency pill, it might not work<br><br></b>
Yep, if you vomit within two hours of taking it, consult with the person who prescribed it to see if you need to take it again (or maybe just get an IUD) to protect against pregnancy.
<br><br><b>6) The emergency pill doesn\’t provide <br><br></b>
lasting protection
Don\’t give yourself a double pregnancy scare! If you have unprotected sex any time after taking an emergency contraceptive pill, you could get pregnant. Also, be aware that the emergency pill can temporarily impact the efficacy of other forms of contraception so, if you take EC, check with your health care provider about if you need to use extra protection - and for how long.

    <string name="The_Pill_vs_Pregnancy_ALL_Your_Questions_Answered_content"><![CDATA[If you want easy, effective contraception that puts the power in your hands, contraceptive pills can be a great choice. They provide a high level of protection against pregnancy (up to 91 percent with typical use), plus they could potentially get rid of some of your cycle\’s less pleasant aspects (adiós, PMS). But with so much to know about taking birth control pills, how can you be certain you\’re using it correctly? What if you miss a pill or think you might be pregnant?

<br><br>To find out, we asked OB-GYN Sara Twogood to answer all your pill- and pregnancy-related questions, so you can feel confident about your contraception..
<br><br><b>When am I most likely to get pregnant on <br><br></b>
contraceptive pills?
Key times are when you forget to take it, are
late starting a new pack, or its effectiveness is impacted. Specifically, "Illness - such as
vomiting or diarrhea - can mean your pill isn\’t absorbed properly by the body," says Sara. "There are also a small number of antibiotics and medications that can affect it [effectiveness], so always discuss other
medications with your doctor."
<br><br><b>How many pills do I have to miss to get <br><br></b>
pregnant?
It\’s crucial to read the instructions for your
contraceptive pill! Each type is different, so
there is no one-size-fits-all approach.

<br><br>"For some pills that have both estrogen and
progesterone, it might be ok to miss one pill, as long as you take the missed pill as soon as possible, and the rest of the pack as normal," says Sara.

<br><br>Missing a pill at the beginning of a new pack is more likely to be a problem than missing one in the middle of a pack. For the progesterone-only pill, you have to take it within 3 hours or 12 hours of your regular pill time, and if you miss any pills, you won\’t be protected. Regardless of the type of pill, the best way to prevent pregnancy and maximize pill effectiveness is to take it at the same time every day.
<br><br><b>How can I tell if I am pregnant while taking <br><br></b>
contraceptive pills?
Just like when you\’re not taking contraceptive pills, the first and most obvious sign of a pregnancy is the absence of regular "periods" - end-of-the-pack withdrawal bleeds.

<br><br>"If you are taking a pill where you would
normally experience withdrawal bleeding
(during your pill-free days at the end of a pack, or if you take placebo or sugar pills during the last seven days of the pack), it will stop, as rising levels of pregnancy hormone hCG override the synthetic hormones in the pill."

<br><br>There are other common symptoms - more on these below - but because people experience pregnancy differently symptoms are not a reliable way to determine pregnancy. If there\’s a chance you could be pregnant, the only surefire way to know is by taking a pregnancy test.

<br><br>"It can also be a normal side effect of taking the contraceptive pill. If you\’ve been on it for a long time, one of the effects it has is to make your endometrium (the lining of your uterus) thinner. It can become too thin to bleed, so you may skip a period for this reason" adds Sara.
<br><br><b>Can being on the contraceptive pill affect a pregnancy test? <br><br></b>
No. "Pregnancy tests - both standard urine
tests and blood tests - measure levels of hCG, a hormone that the body produces during pregnancy," says Sara. "HCG production isn\’t affected by the synthetic estrogen and/or progesterone contained in birth control, so being on hormonal contraception won\’t interfere with the results of a pregnancy test."
<br><br><b>I skip periods on my pill - how can I tell if <br><br></b>
I\’m pregnant?
Without a regular monthly bleed acting as an indicator, there is only one way to find out for certain. "Whether you take contraceptive pills back-to-back without a break (or any inactive or placebo pills) so that you don\’t experience monthly bleeds; or you simply don\’t get bleeds as a normal side effect of your hormonal contraception, again, if you think there\’s a chance you may be pregnant, the best course of action is to take a test" says Sara.

<br><br>Bear in mind that it takes time for a fertilized egg to reach the uterus, implant, and get to a point where it releases enough hCG to be detected in a urine test, so don\’t go rushing to take a test. It\’s advisable to wait two weeks after unprotected sex before taking a urine pregnancy test.
<br><br><b>Would I get the same pregnancy symptoms as people who aren\’t on the contraceptive
pill? <br><br></b>
Being on the contraceptive pill won\’t have an impact on pregnancy symptoms, because the pregnancy hormones (rising hG, estrogen, and progesterone, among others) will override hormones in birth control.

<br><br>"In terms of the physical signs of pregnancy, it\’s about noticing changes from how you
normally feel," says Sara. "Early pregnancy
symptoms have a lot of crossover with PMS symptoms - breast tenderness, bloating,
moodiness, fatigue. But with many combined pills, PMS symptoms are lessened, or you don\’t experience them at all. However, if you conceive, the pregnancy hormones will take over and may trigger these symptoms - so it\’s looking for that change, experiencing symptoms you don\’t generally get."

<br><br>On the other hand, early on you might not even notice or experience pregnancy symptoms.

<br><br>"Pregnancy really is different for everyone.
While some may get severe morning sickness, for example, others only experience light nausea or none at all," says Sara. "Some people are less sensitive to changes in their bodies, or may think symptoms such as fatigue or poor sleep are due to stress or feeling unwell."

<br><br>Rather than focusing on symptoms alone, think about the likelihood pregnancy has occurred ask yourself \’Did I miss or take pills late?\’ and \’Could anything have affected my pill?\’ If you\’ve had unprotected sex, it\’s best to take a pregnancy test to find out."
<br><br><b>Could I still get regular bleeding on the
contraceptive pill and be pregnant? <br><br></b>
You may experience some light bleeding, but regular periods are very unlikely. "During the initial part of pregnancy, some people
experience an implantation bleed, which occurs when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus," says Sara. "It usually occurs around the time you would expect to have a period, so it\’s possible to mistake this for a light period. Also, pregnancy can cause changes to the cervix, which can again result in light bleeding
or spotting after sex, for example.

<br><br>However, it isn\’t possible to experience a
normal, regular period if you\’re pregnant
once your body starts producing the pregnancy hormone hG, your periods stop. When people don\’t discover pregnancies until a few months in, it\’s usually because their monthly withdrawal bleed was so light that they didn\’t notice the difference or because they had an irregular cycle - not because they kept having periods."
<br><br><b>Should I keep taking the contraceptive pill if I think I may be pregnant? <br><br></b>
If you get a positive result from a pregnancy test, it\’s best to stop taking your pill. "There is little risk of the birth control pill having any impact, but it\’s best to stop as a precaution," says Sara. "The reason to take it is to prevent pregnancy, and if you are pregnant, you shouldn\’t be taking any external hormones unless it\’s medically indicated."
<br><br><b>Can I take emergency contraception if I <br><br></b>
think my pill may not have worked?
Yes, you can take emergency contraception in addition to birth control pills, if you\’ve missed pills or think their effectiveness may have been impacted by sickness or medication and you\’ve had unprotected sex.

<br><br>"It won\’t affect the effectiveness of your
contraceptive pill, but you may find it causes irregular bleeding or nausea and bloating," says Sara. "It\’s important to remember to continue taking your normal pills as scheduled though it\’s not emergency contraception or your birth control pill. It\’s emergency contraception and your birth control pill."

    <string name="Positive_Pregnancy_Test_What_s_Next">Positive Pregnancy Test - What\’s Next</string>
    <string name="Positive_Pregnancy_Test_What_s_Next_content"><![CDATA[Getting a positive pregnancy test can be a very emotional and confusing experience. Whether you were planning a pregnancy or not, having it confirmed can bring out a range of emotions that you weren\’t prepared for, or it may make you feel quite disconnected.

<br><br>However you\’re feeling, what\’s key to know is that your reaction is completely natural and normal. "A positive pregnancy test can bring up all sorts of feelings, from excitement and elation to fear or anxiety, to anger, guilt, or worry. You may experience different emotions at different points, or cycle through all of them, while you process what\’s happening," psychologist Holly Kozee explains.
<br><br><b>No emotion you have is unusual or wrong, <br><br></b>
and all are normal. Don\’t worry about what
you\’re feeling, just allow yourself to
experience it and don\’t put yourself under
any extra pressure.
To help you navigate this, here are some
simple, practical steps you can take to help you work through your feelings and best support yourself at this time.
<br><br><b>Consider taking another test<br><br></b>
"Why would I do this?" you may ask. Well,
although it\’s fairly rare, it is possible to get a false positive on a pregnancy test. There\’s a small number of medications that can distort the results of a urine test, and certain medical conditions can cause the levels of pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to rise even when you\’re not pregnant. Depending on the type of test and how you took it, it\’s also possible to get a positive result if a second evaporation line appears once your urine has dried. This is why it\’s key to follow the
test instructions and check the results within the set time frame given.

<br><br>"If it gives you peace of mind to do a second test, and you have the resources to get one, you should definitely do this," says Holly. "But it\’s best to go into it knowing that false positives are statistically rare, and it\’s more likely that you will get another positive result. Just try not to go into it thinking that you might get a different outcome, because that\’s unlikely, and you don\’t want to put yourself through any extra stress."
<br><br><b>Process your emotions<br><br></b>
However you feel, or however your feelings
fluctuate, what\’s key is to sit with and process your emotions. "Give yourself time and space to come to terms with and accept the situation, and then, over time, work out how you feel about it," Holly says. "Right now, you don\’t need to act. You don\’t need to do anything. You don\’t need to make a plan. Just pause and allow things to sink in, and don\’t put yourself under any pressure. Allow yourself the time and space
for your feelings to emerge."

<br><br>A helpful practice can be to "notice, name, and allow" your emotions. Go somewhere quiet where you can work out what you\’re feeling, rather than simply feeling it. Once you\’ve noticed and observed the feeling, give it a name this can help you differentiate between similar feelings such as doubt, uncertainty, and anxiety. Finally, rather than fighting this feeling, allow yourself to experience it, so you\’re able to understand and accept it, rather than struggling against it or what you think you should feel.
<br><br><b>Practice self-care<br><br></b>
"Because it can be a very uncertain time, be
extra kind to yourself and practice helpful,
healthy, and holistic activities," says Holly. "If you\’re struggling with your thoughts and
feelings, try getting out in the fresh air for a
walk - getting physical and interacting in the moment can distract you from unhelpful
overthinking and allow you to process things in a more constructive way."

<br><br>Guided breathing exercises can also be helpful, particularly for stress and anxiety, by helping slow down breathing and heart rate and getting more oxygen into your body. "When we are stressed, we tend to take shallow breaths which can set off our sympathetic nervous system, keeping us in a fight-or-flight stressed state," Holly explains. "Deep breathing, on the other hand, stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes a state of
calmness. For the same reason, gentle
activities like yoga, which combine mindfulness and breathwork, can also be helpful."

<br><br>Or you could try journaling - get a notebook
and write down everything you feel, so you can get the thoughts out of your head and onto paper. This can help you feel calmer and less overwhelmed, accept what\’s happening, and help you explore and understand your feelings about it.
<br><br><b>Get some support<br><br></b>
This might feel difficult if you\’re still struggling
with your own emotions and aren\’t sure how
you feel. However, if you can, it\’s a good idea to
talk in confidence to someone you trust about
what\’s happening.
"Whether it\’s a friend or family member,
reaching out to someone you know will
understand will help. By simply listening and
offering support, they can help you feel less
overwhelmed and more able to process your
situation. It\’s a good idea, if possible, to explain
upfront how you\’re feeling
- even if that\’s just
uncertain or confused - so they can respond
sensitively."

<br><br>"If talking to someone close doesn\’t feel
comfortable, you could make an appointment with your doctor to talk through your situation and access any relevant support, or see an independent, accredited therapist who can help you work through your feelings and what feels right for you," Holly adds.

<br><br>You could also reach out to others via
supportive online forums, where you can ask for advice from people in a similar situation or who have been through this themselves. Reaching out and opening up about your feelings, having a safe space to ask questions, or simply knowing there are people going through the same thing can provide vital support and help you find clarity in terms of your feelings and your future.

<br><br>Give yourself time, don\’t put yourself under any pressure, and see how your feelings settle, so you can feel secure in them and what feels right for you.

    <string name="Hate_the_Wait_What_Are_the_Earliest_Signs_of_Pregnancy">Hate the Wait: What Are the Earliest Signs of Pregnancy</string>
    <string name="Hate_the_Wait_What_Are_the_Earliest_Signs_of_Pregnancy_content"><![CDATA[Whatever the reason you think you might be
pregnant, playing the waiting game until you can take a pregnancy test is officially The Worst. So what are some of the earliest signs you could be pregnant (and we stress, could)? We\’ve got the lowdown...
<br><br><b>Your period\’s late<br><br></b>
A late or missing period is the most obvious sign, right? Right. But don\’t start reading into it as soon as the clock strikes midnight on your first day late! Most of us don\’t have a cycle that runs like clockwork - in fact, cycle length can vary up to seven days and still be considered regular.
<br><br><b>You thought you had your period … then it
went away again<br><br></b>
If you were due, had a little spotting, and then ... nothing, there\’s a chance it might have been implantation bleeding, not your period. This is when - if you were pregnant - an embryo would implant into the lining of the uterus, which can cause some very light bleeding.
<br><br><b>Your breasts look or feel different<br><br></b>
Pregnancy = lots of potential changes to your boobs. Sensitive nipples may be an early pregnancy sign. Your breasts might get bigger and feel sore (like before a period). Later on in pregnancy, there are likely to be more visible changes - the veins will probably stand out more and the nipples get darker.
<br><br><b>You\’ve got weird cravings... <br><br></b>
Normally got a sweeth tooth, but now you\’re all about the salty snacks? Never been an ice cream person, but suddenly you can\’t get enough? Pregnancy can cause people to crave things they don\’t normally. Oh, and get this, that even extends to things that aren\’t edible think toothpaste, coal, or soil - which can be a sign of a nutrient deficiency (and definitely something to get checked out!).
<br><br><b>... But can\’t stand other foods<br><br></b>
Common culprits during pregnancy are tea,
coffee, and fatty foods. You might also notice you\’re super sensitive to the smell of food or cooking. Basically, a massive breakfast = your idea of hell.
<br><br><b>You\’ve got a weird taste in your mouth<br><br></b>
It might be kind of metallic, like you\’ve been
sucking on coins! The technical name is
dysgeusia, which seems an unnecessarily
complicated way to say "yucky taste," right?
Using more herbs, spices, and acidic foods like citrus fruit in your meals can help override it.
<br><br><b>You\’re wiped out<br><br></b>
It\’s really common to feel tired, or full-on
exhausted, in the early stages of pregnancy
in fact, it affects around 90 percent of pregnant people. It\’s likely due to hormonal changes, which might also make you feel more emotional. A challenging combo!
<br><br><b>You notice more discharge than usual<br><br></b>
You\’ve probably noticed that this varies
through your cycle anyway (don\’t forget you
can log discharge in Flo to get to know what\’s normal for you). And when you\’re pregnant, it\’s also common for your body to produce more than normal - it\’s the body\’s way of stopping infections from traveling up your vagina to your uterus. (But note: The discharge shouldn\’t have a strong smell or come with any unpleasant symptoms, which could be signs of an infection and warrants a trip to the doctor).
<br><br><b>You need to pee all the time<br><br></b>
... including during the night (which is just great for your sleep). Other people find early pregnancy brings on constipation. Hey, you could even score a double whammy and have both!

<br><br>While it\’s tempting to try to decode the signals your body is sending you, remember that (a) pregnancy symptoms show up in different ways for different people,
and (b) all of these symptoms could easily be caused by something other than pregnancy - including PMS. Your best bet? Try not to read too much into any symptoms and wait until you can take a pregnancy test to find out what\’s really going on.
<br><br><i>Change of life plans? If you\’re trying to get
pregnant, you can switch to the Trying to
Conceive mode in Flo so you\’ll be alerted to
your most fertile days. If you do find out you\’re
pregnant and plan to have the baby, you can
switch to Pregnancy mode so you can track
your entire pregnancy and get all the support
and info you need. Just head to "Settings" in
your profile to change modes any time. <br><br></i>

    <string name="_8_Early_Pregnancy_Symptoms_That_Feel_A_Lot_Like_PMS">8 Early Pregnancy Symptoms That Feel A Lot Like PMS</string>
    <string name="_8_Early_Pregnancy_Symptoms_That_Feel_A_Lot_Like_PMS_content"><![CDATA[Do you ever get the feeling Mother Nature is the ultimate prankster? Case in point: many of the early signs of pregnancy are the same as symptoms you might get when your period is on its way.<br><br>
Your best bet if you think there\’s a chance
you\’re pregnant? Wait to see if your period
arrives - and do a pregnancy test if it\’s late
rather than overanalyze every twinge and pain in your body. (Oh, and start logging your pre period symptoms in Flo so you get to know your normal - and limit the freak-outs!)<br><br>
That said, if you still want to know the signs
that can signal both PMS and pregnancy, here are some to watch for..
<br><br><b>1) Sore breasts<br><br></b>
Hormonal changes in early pregnancy can
your breasts getting larger and feeling tender. You may also get a tingling sensation or soreness, especially in your nipples. This is because there\’s a surge in levels of the hormone progesterone, plus the milk ducts start to grow. But if you\’re not planning a pregnancy and your boobs are giving you grief, don\’t panic. Sore breasts are also a really common PMS symptom. But this time, they\’re linked to hormonal changes that happen before your period. Your best bet? Don\’t overthink it! Just wait to see if your period arrives as expected - if it does, that nagging doubt (and breast discomfort) will soon disappear.
<br><br><b>2) An upset stomach<br><br></b>
Pregnancy brings an extra helping of the
hormone progesterone. While this is vital for a healthy pregnancy, one of its unwelcome side effects is constipation and bloating. But this can also be a sign your period is on the way, because the second phase of your cycle (after ovulation, but before menstruation) also involves elevated levels of progesterone. Again, try to keep your cool. While you wait for your period, drinking lots of water, exercising, and adding more fiber to your diet (think vegetables, fruit, beans, whole grain bread, whole wheat pasta, and brown rice) can help ease constipation.
<br><br><b>3) Feeling sick<br><br></b>
Ah, morning sickness - that classic pregnancy symptom we\’ve all heard of. Although, the name is something of a misnomer - it can occur at any time of day (it\’s just that mornings are the most common). Once again, hormones are at fault, making 50-90 percent of pregnant
people nauseous in their first trimester. But
you guessed it - PMS can also cause nausea. And let\’s not forget that the lead up to your period can bring headaches, trouble sleeping, and bloating all of which might leave you feeling queasy. Eating smaller, more frequent meals; sipping on cool drinks; and eating foods that contain ginuer ult held take the edge off, whatever the cause. And try (we know it\’s hard!) not to stress while you wait on your period - as that can also upset your stomach. Hello vicious cycle.
<br><br><b>4) Abdominal cramps<br><br></b>
This might be a symptom you assume is
100 percent associated with your period, but abdominal cramps - which feel like menstrual cramps - are actually common in early pregnancy too, caused by a fertilized egg implanting in the womb. Either way,
acetaminophen (paracetamol) is considered sate during pregnancy, so you can take it to take the edge off the discomfort. If PMS is to blame, your period is likely only around the corner. And remember - there are heaps of reasons for stomach pain, so try not to read too much into them in terms of a potential pregnancy. (Though do get them checked out if they persist or if you have other symptoms you\’re worried about so you can rule out other health issues).
<br><br><b>5) Bleeding<br><br></b>
Your period is here … or is it? Light bleeding
can actually occur in early pregnancy - it\’s
called implantation bleeding and happens when the developing embryo attaches to the lining of your uterus. Annoyingly enough, it often occurs at the exact time your period is due. However, any confusion shouldn\’t last long, since implantation bleeding is usually just light spotting. If the bleeding is heavier, it\’s probably the beginning of your period. (Although if you\’ve already taken a pregnancy test and it was positive, this could be a sign of miscarriage. So definitely report this to your doctor and get their advice).
<br><br><b>6) Funky food cravings<br><br></b>
We\’ve all heard the stories of people who
wanted to munch on ice cubes or eat custard on carrots when they were pregnant. Once again, food cravings are the result of changes in hormone levels in pregnancy. But hankering after certain foods - and a change in appetite - are really common in the run up to your period too. One way you may be able to tell the difference is that pregnancy cravings are usually more distinct. Plus, some pregnant
people have cravings for non-food items, like toothpaste, coal, or even soil (this can be a sign of a vitamin deficiency, which is worth getting checked out). There\’s also a tendency in pregnancy to be really repulsed by certain types of food - even the smell of them because your sense of smell can be
heightened.
<br><br><b>7) Mood swings<br><br></b>
Here\’s another fun one to mess with your
head - quite literally. Your emotions being out of whack is common in the first trimester (three months) of pregnancy … and it\’s a symptom of PMS. Naturally, if you\’re fretting about whether you might be pregnant, that\’s only going to add to it. If you\’re feeling low or anxious, try to focus on your health essentials - getting enough
sleep, eating well, exercising, spending time with a friend/partner/pet. And remember
worrying about a potential pregnancy won\’t
change the outcome, so try your best to stay calm while you wait for your period.
<br><br><b>8) Feeling rundown<br><br></b>
Tiredness or flat-out exhaustion is common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. But it\’s also a classic symptom of PMS. But let\’s be honest there are heaps of other potential causes for feeling drained too, from the obvious (late nights, working too much, or exercising too hard) to the less obvious (a nutrient deficiency, anxiety, or an underactive thyroid). So really, this isn\’t a symptom to read too much into in terms of deciding whether you\’re pregnant. Again, try to keep your cool and wait on that period. (Although, side note: if you\’ve been feeling tired all the time for more than four weeks, it\’s worth seeing your doctor just to rule out any other health issues).

    <string name="How_Soon_Can_I_Take_a_Pregnancy_Test_content"><![CDATA[If you suspect you might be pregnant, it\’s only natural to want to take a pregnancy test ASAP. But just how early can you take a test? And how accurate will the results be
We\’ve got the lowdown...
<br><br><b>I think I might be pregnant - when can I take a test? <br><br></b>
Let\’s be totally clear - testing immediately (or even a few days) after having sex is too early more on the science of why later.<br><br>
Exactly how early you can test depends on the product you choose. Some early pregnancy tests are designed to be used as soon as eight days after possible conception. But remember to take a close look at the claims on the packaging. While at-home pregnancy tests are generally about 97-99 percent accurate, the accuracy can drop significantly the earlier you use it - even if it\’s marketed as an early pregnancy test.<br><br>
Most other at-home tests are designed to be taken after the expected first day of
a late period. But to do that, you\’ll have to know exactly when yours is due. So if you\’re not totally sure, your best bet is to wait until
21 days after you had unprotected sex to get a reliable result. That\’s a loooong wait, we know but testing too early means running the risk of a false negative (the test says you\’re not pregnant, but, in fact, you are).<br><br>
Don\’t forget, if you\’ve had unprotected sex (or your birth control method failed, e.g.,
a broken condom or missed pill) five or fewer days ago and you don\’t want to become pregnant, emergency contraception is an option.
<br><br><b>Why is testing "too early" a problem? <br><br></b>
It all comes down to how pregnancy tests work. They detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). But the body only starts producing it after a fertilized egg has grown into the lining of your uterus (which can happen as soon as six days after ovulation, but usually happens 8-10 days after). So if you test too soon, hG production may not have kicked in yet or the levels may be too low to detect. Even 14 days after ovulation, about eight percent of people get a false-negative result on their pregnancy test. (On the other hand, if you get a positive result, regardless of when, it\’s almost definitely accurate, because it means hG has been detected).<br><br>
After implantation, hG begins doubling about every 48-72 hours, so the margin for error shrinks pretty fast.<br><br>
But remember, an accurate result also depends on you taking the test exactly as the instructions tell you to.
<br><br><b>Can my doctor give me a pregnancy test earlier?<br><br></b>

Good question. A blood test can detect lower levels of hG than a urine test, so it can confirm a pregnancy as early as 11 days past ovulation. However, depending on where you live, your doctor may not offer this routinely. So you might need to do an at-home urine test before you talk to them anyway. Plus, a blood test has to be sent to a lab, so you wouldn\’t get to skip the wait entirely and it will likely cost you more.
<br><br><b>But what if I just can\’t wait? <br><br></b>
We hear you! It\’s tough to play the waiting
game. But it\’s better to wait than to rush into a test, get a misleading result, and send yourself on an emotional rollercoaster. Hold tight, you\’ve got this.

    <string name="Pregnancy_Paranoia_How_to_Handle_It_content"><![CDATA[When it comes to getting your period each
month, what\’s your usual vibe? Fairly relaxed, aside from the less-than-great symptoms and underwear backup plans? Or full-blown panic mode, "This is it ….. I knew it…. I\’m PREGNANT ….. oh wait, here it is, thank god, wow you really had me that time!" (lies down, cuddles a hot water bottle). If the latter is ringing a bell, don\’t worry (about worrying at least) because you are not alone.
Pregnancy paranoia - stressing about the
possibility of being pregnant to the point of
taking pregnancy tests after sex every time or being convinced you\’re pregnant despite using contraception (or not having sex at all) - is very real. And it can make people so stressed that they give up sex altogether.
<br><br><b>What\’s triggering it? <br><br></b>
As OB-GYN Sara Twogood explains, this kind of pregnancy paranoia is something she has come across in her work, and there are a number of reasons behind it.
"We are taught from a young age the \’dangers\’ of sex, and often that education comes in the form of \’You can get pregnant anytime, anywhere,\’ says Dr. Twogood. "This includes being worried about pre-cum and sex acts that aren\’t intercourse."
"The other triggers come from being worried about the enormity of the situation and what they should do, what their partner would think, feel, or say to them, and how other people will react. It\’s certainly a big, important event, but it\’s also something we\’ve been taught to see as a worst-case scenario and almost as something we don\’t have any control over, which isn\’t the case."
So if you\’re finding yourself unduly stressed
every time you have sex, or even when you
haven\’t had sex at all, here\’s a reality check
from an expert on the most common
pregnancy fears, so you can get back to
enjoying your sex life.
<br><br><b>Pregnancy fear: No contraception is 100%
effective. <br><br></b>
<b>Reality: True, but some can be 99% effective (and you can double up). <br><br></b>
Used correctly, contraception can give near-
perfect protection so you can enjoy fun,
healthy, mood-boosting sex, which is the kind of odds we\’ll take.
"For most methods of birth control, there are two effectiveness ratings - perfect use and typical use. If taken according to the
instructions - AKA used perfectly - both
types of pill (combined and progesterone only) have an efficacy of 99%. With typical use, which takes human error into account - for example, missing pills, taking them late, or illness - the effectiveness is 91% (which is still pretty high)." So if you take an organized and mindful approach - set a reminder on your phone and take it at a set
time every day (e.g., with breakfast) - it\’s
highly effective birth control.
When a hormonal birth control method is
combined with a barrier method such as a
condom, pregnancy is even less likely (and
you\’ll also be protected from STIs).
It can also be helpful to understand how
contraceptives work. For example, the
combined pill stops ovulation and thickens the mucus in the cervix, so it\’s harder for sperm to reach an egg, and it thins the uterine lining, so there\’s less chance of a fertilized egg implanting. Knowing all the ways contraception prevents pregnancy can help allay your fears.
<br><br><b>Pregnancy fear: I had protected sex, but
what if something went wrong? <br><br></b>
<b>Reality: Protected sex = very low chance of pregnancy. <br><br></b>
This is when it\’s so important to have faith in your contraception and trust it to do its job because when used correctly, it will.
"When we\’re first learning about sex, whether it\’s at school, through a friend or a family member, or reading about it, there can be a negative emphasis around the effectiveness of contraception, and the information given tends to focus on typical, rather than perfect, use. So you might hear something like \’condoms are only 87% effective\’ or \’contraceptive pills are only 91% effective.\’ These percentages are actually quite high, and when these methods are used perfectly - which is entirely feasible
with thought and care - they\’re even higher,"
notes Dr. Twogood.
Plus, when something goes wrong with
contraception, you know about it - the
condom breaks or you miss a pill - and you
can take action, such as taking emergency
contraception or using another form of
contraception to cover you.
<br><br><b>Pregnancy fear: I can get pregnant any time of the month. <br><br></b>
<b>Reality: True, but only for up to seven days
of it (phew). <br><br></b>
"There are really only six to seven days each cycle when pregnancy is highly likely,
" says Dr. Twogood. "Those are the five days before ovulation (because sperm can stay alive inside the female reproductive tract for up to five days) and the day of ovulation itself. The egg can be fertilized for 24 hours, so the day after ovulation is often included in this fertile window since it\’s hard to know exactly what time of day ovulation occurred. After this, you can\’t get pregnant until after your next menstrual cycle has started. The issue is that ovulation shifts around due to various factors, so you\’ll never really know when it is, which is why it\’s even possible to get pregnant during the tail end of your period if you have short cycles." This is also why the combined pill is such an effective contraceptive option - it prevents ovulation, so you don\’t have a fertile window to think about.
<br><br><b>Pregnancy fear: Sperm stays inside the
body for days. <br><br></b>
<b>Reality: True, but only for five days (and
possibly more like two to three). <br><br></b>
Although this is partially true (and quite weird when you start thinking about it), there is a time limit, which is why it\’s so handy to know when you ovulate.
"Sperm can live inside the female reproductive tract for up to five days - though two to three days is more likely for sperm to stay active and if they are alive, they are capable of fertilizing an egg," says Dr. Twogood. "So if you have unprotected sex within the five days before your ovulation day, it\’s possible you could get pregnant, and the closer to ovulation you have sex, the more likely it is that the sperm will be able to fertilize the egg."
Once again, the form of birth control that
suppresses ovulation is a great protection in this case.
<br><br><b>Pregnancy fear: I can get pregnant from
pre-cum. <br><br></b>
<b>Reality: The jury\’s out, so though the
chance may be low, it\’s best to play it safe. <br><br></b>
Pre-cum (also known as pre-ejaculate) is a
small amount of fluid that comes out of the
penis during arousal but before ejaculation.
"Some people do have sperm in their pre-
cum," says Dr. Twogood. "In terms of
quantifying how often this results in
pregnancy, it\’s quite difficult, as there have
only been a small number of studies done
around precum. Looking at people who
practice withdrawal for birth control - you
might know it as pulling out - this has a 78% effectiveness rate as a contraceptive method, which means that over the course of a year of using this method, 22 out of 100 people will get pregnant. However, this failure rate is not believed to be due to precum but user error, meaning they don\’t pull out fast enough and ejaculate within the vagina."
As always, the best way to prevent pregnancy is to use contraception.
<br><br><b>Pregnancy fear: Emergency contraception
doesn\’t work.
<br><br>Reality: The sooner you take it, the more
effective it is. So don\’t dawdle. <br><br></b>
Because emergency contraception needs to be used as soon as possible after unprotected sex to be most effective, some people wrongly believe that it doesn\’t work.

<br><br>"It is true that the closer to sex that emergency contraception is used, the more effective it is." says Dr. Twogood. "That\’s why the term \’morning-after pill\’ was coined - it\’s the most effective when taken right away. However, it can still be effective for up to three to five days after sex, depending on which one you take."

<br><br>If you have to take emergency contraception before you ovulate, it works by delaying or preventing ovulation. If ovulation has already occurred, it can also make it harder for sperm to reach and fertilize the egg.

<br><br>However, prevention is better than cure.
"Emergency contraception isn\’t foolproof.
After taking the morning-after pill, between
0.6% to 2.7% of women go on to become
pregnant. It\’s best to use an effective form of contraception and keep this as a last resort."
<br><br><b>Pregnancy fear: Oral sex will make me
pregnant. </b>
<br><br><b>Reality: You can\’t get pregnant from oral
sex. <br><br></b>
This is a fear that stems from the "You can get pregnant from everything" thinking that many of us grew up with. The truth is you can\’t get pregnant from oral sex.

<br><br>"Sperm can\’t survive anywhere in the human body apart from the female reproductive tract," says Dr. Twogood. "And the only way you can get pregnant is if sperm gets inside the female reproductive tract. If it goes anywhere else - such as your mouth - you won\’t get pregnant."

<br><br>In fact, oral sex can be a great penetrative sex alternative to enjoy together if you\’re anxious about pregnancy. Consider that a heads up!
<br><br><b>Pregnancy fear: My partner came on my
labia/anus/thigh - could the sperm have
gotten into my vagina? <br><br></b>
<b>Reality: If it\’s not in your vagina, you can\’t
get pregnant. <br><br></b>
Again, this is a common myth heard when we were learning about sex and pregnancy that often isn\’t corrected. But, as outlined above (you can\’t get pregnant from oral sex), to get pregnant, sperm from the penis needs to get inside the female reproductive tract - which means inside the vagina, not outside or near it. "Outside the body, sperm dies within a very short period of time, and within the body, it can only survive in the uterus or uterine tubes," says Dr. Twogood.
"Essentially, unless your partner came inside you, and you\’re not using any form of
contraception, you\’re very unlikely to be
pregnant."
<br><br><b>Pregnancy fear: My partner touched
themself, then touched me. <br><br></b>
<b>Reality: Touching each other = low chance
of pregnancy. <br><br></b>
Again, this is another situation where the risk factor has been blown out of proportion. In reality, there is a very low chance of getting pregnant from touching.
"It can be helpful to think that, even from a
starting point of a person ejaculating into a
vagina, and that happening on the most fertile day of the month, there isn\’t a 100% chance of getting pregnant - and the likelihood drops with age," says Dr. Twogood. "Once you start to peel back from that, and take away the act of ejaculating in the vagina, the penetration of the vagina, to the point where what\’s happened is that your partner has touched their penis, then touched your vagina, the chances of pregnancy are very low."
<br><br><b>Pregnancy fear: I didn\’t have sex, but I\’m
still anxious I could be pregnant! </b>
<br><br><b>Reality: No chance of pregnancy. But some tracking may reduce your stress! <br><br></b>
In terms or contraceptive metnoas, absunence is the only one that provides 100% protection from pregnancy, so consider this fear CANCELLED.

<br><br>If this is your story, it\’s important to reassure yourself that you don\’t have any reason to be worried and try thinking of ways to lessen this anxiety. "Try to be more aware of your cycle and how you feel at different times," says Dr.Twogood. "If you\’re not on the combined pill (and even sometimes even if you are) and are approaching your period, PMS symptoms
have a lot of crossover with early pregnancy symptoms (mood swings, breast tenderness, bloating), and you may be feeling more emotional and worrying unnecessarily at this time."

    <string name="White_Discharge_Why_Do_You_Have_Milky_Vaginal_Fluid_content"><![CDATA[Have you ever spotted this discharge (or
noticed how it loves to show up on your
underwear)? We\’ve got the lowdown on what causes it...
<br><br><b>What does it look like? </b>
 First and foremost,
there\’s no "right" way for white vaginal
discharge to look. Depending on where you are in your cycle, your vaginal discharge may appear:

<br><br>Clear or white - right after your period ends

<br><br>Thick and whitish - as you approach your
fertile days

<br><br>Opaque and creamy - after ovulation until your next period
<br><br><b>Is it a problem? </b> The short answer is no! <br><br>
Typically, white discharge is a sign that
everything is working well. Remember, the vagina should always have some secretions. Fluctuations in discharge texture and color can be caused by fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone throughout your cycle.

<br><br>However, if your discharge becomes white and lumpy, like cottage cheese, that could be a sign of a yeast infection (which is totally treatable, don\’t worry!). Other symptoms to watch for that could indicate an infection include itching; swelling or redness; vaginal/lower belly pain; pain during sex or when you pee; or an unpleasant smell to your discharge.
<br><br><b>What can you do? </b> If you\’ve got any of the
above symptoms, head to a health care
provider to get checked out - and get
treatment if needed.

<br><br>No symptoms? It sounds like your body is just doing its thing, and you don\’t need to interfere. But one thing you can do is log your discharge, which is a great way to spot any changes early on.
<br><br><b>Anything else it might be? </b> Possibly. An
increased amount of milky white discharge is normal during early pregnancy because there\’s more estrogen circulating in your body. However, it\’s also totally normal when you\’re not pregnant. So your best bet? Don\’t leap to any conclusions based on a little fluid alone...

discharge on your underwear or when you
wipe. But don\’t panic - here\’s everything you
need to know ...
<br><br><b>What does it look like?<br><br></b> Anything from the
slightest tinge to saturated yellow - think off-white to sunflower bright.
<br><br></b>Is it a problem? </b> It all depends on the shade as well as whether you\’ve got any other
symptoms. A slight yellowness to your
discharge - without any other symptoms
usually isn\’t cause for concern. In fact, white vaginal discharge often appears more yellowish when it dries, especially when compared to a white pantiliner or underwear.

<br><br>But if it\’s a stronger hue, excessive, or you have other symptoms, it could be a sign of an infection.

<br><br>Several sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including trichomoniasis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea can cause yellow discharge. Pelvic inflammatory disease, which is an infection of the uterus, ovaries, and uterine tubes, can cause it too. But don\’t panic! These can all be treated if taken care of timely.

<br><br>Other signs to watch for include itching,
burning, swelling, or redness around the
vagina; pain when peeing or having sex; an
unpleasant smell to your discharge; frothy or foamy discharge; bleeding during sex/between periods; pain in your lower belly; and/or a fever.

<br><br>However, STIs often don\’t have any symptoms at all. So don\’t ignore it if a change in discharge is the only thing you\’ve noticed.
<br><br><b>What can you do? </b> If you have any worrying
symptoms and/or yellow discharge that\’s
excessive or more than off-white, get checked out by a medical professional. Rest assured, all of the above conditions can be treated, but not addressing them can lead to complications. It can be stressful to talk about these symptoms, but taking care of it as soon as possible is the best way to take care of yourself - and you deserve it!
<br><br><b>Anything else it might be? </b> Candidiasis (yeast infection) can sometimes cause
a yellowish discharge. But it\’s more typically associated with white, clumpy discharge -
a bit like cottage cheese.

    <string name="White_Clumpy_Discharge_Why_Does_Discharge_Look_Like_Cottage_Cheese_content"><![CDATA[Whether it\’s the first time you\’ve had it or it\’s a recurrent visitor, here\’s everything you need to know about this type of discharge…
<br><br><b>What does it look like? </b> Thick and lumpy
think cottage cheese.
<br><br><b>Is it a problem? </b> Sorry to break it to you but
this type of discharge might be a sign of
candidiasis AKA yeast infection. Other
symptoms of yeast infection can include genital itching/irritation/swelling and pain when you pee or have sex.

<br><br>If it\’s any consolation, you\’re not alone. Around 3 out of 4 women will get a yeast infection at some point in their lives. It occurs when levels of a yeast called candida (which normally exists in the vagina without causing problems) get out of balance and multiply. This is more likely to
happen if you are or have recently been on
antibiotics, are using hormonal contraception, are pregnant, or have diabetes.
<br><br><b>What can you do? </b> Now for some good news yeast infection is usually easy to treat. If it\’s the first time you\’ve had it you should make an appointment with a health care provider to confirm that\’s what\’s going on. Once treated with a tablet, cream, or suppository
- yeast infections will usually clear up within 7-14 days.

<br><br>If you have recurrent yeast infections (more
than four per year), see your doctor so they can help you figure out what\’s causing it. They might suggest a longer course of treatment to try to get rid of it for good.

<br><br>In addition to that, there are a few things you can try at home that might help to alleviate symptoms or prevent getting another yeast infection: washing your vulva/vagina with just water, drying properly after bathing, and wearing loose-fitting cotton pants.

<br><br>Plus, don\’t forget to log your symptoms
so you can tell if there are any patterns that
could hint at what\’s behind your yeast infection.
<br><br><b>Anything else white clumpy discharge might be? </b> Normal vaginal discharge (which is clear to white) can sometimes contain small clumps, made up of cells your body has shed. It\’s only when you\’re seeing larger lumps - they\’ll look like cottage cheese - that you need to take note.

    <string name="Transparent_Discharge_What_Is_This_Clear_Fluid_content"><![CDATA[Noticed your underwear is wet with clear fluid? Is it your body just doing its thing or is it something to worry about? Let\’s figure it out...
<br><br><b>What does it look like? </b> Anything from a clear, thin, watery fluid to something more like the texture of egg whites.
<br><br><b>Is it a problem? </b> No, it\’s not! As long as the
transparent discharge is odorless and you don\’t have any genital discomfort, it\’s a sign that your vaginal and cervical ecosystems are healthy and finely tuned.

<br><br>You might notice the amount/texture of
transparent discharge varies. This can happen because of the body\’s natural processes and it can also be caused by certain events, like:

<br><br><i>Ovulation</i>

<br><br>In the days before you ovulate, estrogen levels go through the roof, which causes vaginal fluid production to increase. You might notice it changes texture too, becoming a bit like raw egg whites. This is all designed to increase your chances of conceiving, as it makes it easier for sperm to get into your uterus and then on to your tubes where conception would take place.

<br><br><i>Sexual arousal </i>

<br><br>Feeling turned on can also make your body
produce more clear, slippery fluid, which helps to make sex pain-free and more pleasurable.

<br><br><i>Exercising </i>

<br><br>Some people notice an increase in vaginal
discharge during exercise. It may be that some exercises put pressure on your abdomen, which can mean more fluid is squeezed out.
<br><br><b>What can you do? </b> Let\’s get this straight: you don\’t need to do anything! Your normal care
routine is more than enough.

<br><br>It\’s always a good idea to log your discharge to keep a close eye at your reproductive health patterns and spot any changes early.
<br><br><b>Anything else it might be? </b> It\’s unlikely! But if you develop any unpleasant symptoms
including a fever; genital pain/itching; pain
when you pee; tender spots in your groin;
blisters or sores in the genital area; or generally feeling unwell - get checked out by your doctor.

<br><br><b>What does it look like? </b> You might notice
brown, reddish-brown, or black-ish brown
discharge when you go to the bathroom or on your underwear.
<br><br><b>Is it a problem? </b> Not necessarily. In fact, some people have brown discharge every menstrual cycle (log your discharge in Flo, and you\’ll soon get to know what\’s normal for you). It tends to happen when your period is winding down or just starting. At this point, there\’s only a little blood, and it\’s had time to fade to brown before it comes out. You might also notice it if you have lighter periods, are approaching menopause, or if you use contraception that gives you a lighter flow.

<br><br>However, if it isn\’t your norm, it\’s important to take note. Brown discharge in between periods or instead of what your periods normally look like, can be a sign of problems within the uterus or cervix such as polyps or fibroids; or an STI. Fortunately, these are all usually manageable with the help from a medical professional.
<br><br><b>What can you do? </b> If brown discharge isn\’t
normal for you, it happens in between periods, or you have any other symptoms - unpleasant smelling discharge, pain when you pee or have sex, etc. - it\’s always worth getting it checked out by a medical professional to make sure you\’re in tip-top health.
<br><br><b>Anything else it might be? </b> Potentially. If you spot it around two weeks after ovulation it\’s a possible sign of pregnancy. When
a fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus, it causes a small amount of bleeding. But don\’t leap to the conclusion that you\’re pregnant from a little brown discharge alone!

    <string name="Pink_Discharge_What_It_Means_and_What_To_Do_content"><![CDATA[It might sound pretty, but that doesn\’t stop it from ringing alarm bells if you don\’t know what it means. Rest assured - we\’ve got the
answers...
<br><br><b>What does it look like? </b> Discharge with a pink tinge or pink flecks.
<br><br><b>Is it a problem? </b> There\’s a good chance there\’s absolutely nothing to worry about and what you\’re seeing is just a little blood mixed in with your normal discharge. You might notice this at the beginning or end of your period (when your bleeding is light), or if you change contraception - about one third of people get lighter bleeding during their first months of using hormonal birth control.

<br><br>Plus, just before ovulation (when an egg is
released), levels of the hormone estrogen
surge are followed by a drop, which can trigger light spotting around the midpoint of your cycle.

<br><br>However, bleeding in between periods can also be a symptom of a problem, including
polycystic ovary syndrome (a common
condition that affects how your ovaries work), thyroid issues, fibroids (non cancerous growths), polyps and some STIs. Fortunately, these are all usually manageable, if you seek timely medical help.
<br><br><b>What can you do? </b> If you only notice pink
discharge just before or after your period, it\’s not something to worry about. But if it happens between your periods - and especially if you also have symptoms like pain when you pee or during sex or discharge with an unpleasant smell - then it\’s best to get it checked out by your doctor to rule out any health issues.

<br><br>Logging your discharge and symptoms is
a great way to keep track of what\’s going on in your body - and you can bring info to your
doctor so they can make a super-informed
diagnosis.
<br><br><b>Anything else it might be? </b> Possibly. Light
spotting can also occur when a fertilized egg implants itself into the lining of the uterus in early pregnancy. But don\’t let a few flecks of pink convince you you\’re pregnant!

    <string name="Green_Discharge_Is_It_Cause_for_Concern_content"><![CDATA[It\’s pretty surprising how many colors your
discharge can be, huh? Here\’s what you need
to know if you see green...
<br><br><b>What does it look like? </b> Green (obviously!), but it might have a different texture too
- thicker, thinner, more textured, frothy, or foamy.
<br><br><b>Is it a problem? </b> he truth is that most often
green discharge is a sign of an infection. But if you see it, don\’t panic - we\’ll explain what to do next.

<br><br>First a little more context: Bacterial vaginosis (discharge caused by a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina) can cause green discharge. Sexually transmitted infections like trichomoniasis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea can too. Sometimes yeast infections can even have green discharge. This discharge may also have a different texture than normal and an unpleasant, potentially fishy, odor.

<br><br>Other signs of infection include burning, pain and itching when you pee; bleeding between periods; and lower abdominal pain. (Track any symptoms you experience - it\’ll come in handy if you go to the doctor). But we can\’t stress enough that STIs are often symptomless, so even if a change in discharge is all you notice, it\’s important not to ignore it.
<br><br><b>What can you do? </b> Head to a health care
provider to get checked out. Antibiotics are
usually all it takes to treat all of these
conditions. And it\’s best to start treatment right away, because leaving an infection untreated can lead to complications ... Which is exactly what you don\’t want.
<br><br><b>Anything else it might be? </b> Probably not. Green discharge is usually a sign of infection. You might not be used to talking about discharge, but rest assured - to doctors, it\’s no big deal. They\’ve seen and heard it all before. The most important thing is to get you back in good health so you can get back to enjoying your life.

    <string name="Grey_Discharge_Possible_Reasons_Explaine_">Grey Discharge: Possible Reasons Explained</string>
    <string name="Grey_Discharge_Possible_Reasons_Explaine_content"><![CDATA[Ever noticed grey stains on your underwear or toilet paper and wondered why? Wonder no more! Here\’s what you need to know...
<br><br><b>What does it look like? </b> Grey-ish white or grey in color. Plus, you might notice the texture has changed too, becoming either thinner and more watery or thicker than usual.
<br><br><b>Is it a problem? </b> We\’ll be straight with you - it might be. But not one you can\’t solve!

<br><br>You see, grey discharge can be a sign of
bacterial vaginosis, which is caused by a
change in the natural balance of bacteria in
your vagina. The end result - discharge that\’s greyish-white, thin, and watery.

<br><br>Grey discharge can also be a sign of a few
sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. When this is what\’s behind it, it causes grey discharge that\’s thinner or thicker than normal.

<br><br>Other symptoms to watch for include increased and/or smelly discharge; bleeding between periods; and pain when you pee, and most importantly, abdominal pain and fever. Bacterial vaginosis, in particular, can cause a strong, fishy smell. It\’s not especially pleasant, but at least it works as a good warning sign!

<br><br>It\’s worth noting that STIs are often
symptomless so even if a change in discharge is all you\’ve noticed, it\’s best to be safe and get an expert opinion.
<br><br><b>What can you do? </b> The good news? STIs are
treatable.

<br><br>Your best bet is to get checked out by
a medical professional. Left untreated, infection can lead to complications, so it\’s best to take care of it ASAP.
<br><br><b>Anything else it might be? </b> Your discharge
may take on a greyish tinge at different points in your cycle for no reason at all. (Tracking yours can be a good way to get to know what\’s normal for you.)

<br><br>But if you have any doubt at all, head to your health care provider to make sure everything\’s OK.

    <string name="Can_the_COVID_Vaccine_Delay_Periods_">Can the COVID Vaccine Delay Periods?</string>
    <string name="Can_the_COVID_Vaccine_Delay_Periods_content"><![CDATA[Most of us might see some changes in our
menstrual cycle at some point in our lives, and right now there are increasing reports of people noticing shifts in their periods after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. In fact, U.K. figures reveal that as of September 2021, more than 37,000 suspected reactions relating to a whole host of changes - including delayed periods - have
been reported to Medicines & Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
<br><br><b>Q. What changes to my menstrual cycle
might happen after my shots? </b><br><br>A. At the moment, there\’s no scientific data
linking any of the COVID-19 vaccines with
period irregularities, but plenty of women [and people who menstruate] are talking about experiencing effects. So much so that Dr. Kate Clancy, a professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois - who experienced an unusually heavy period after her first dose of the Moderna vaccine - has set up a study to understand people\’s menstrual experiences after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.

<br><br>Dr. O\’Brien says it\’s not known whether more people are experiencing changes after the first or second dose of vaccine but, "The MHRA has said that a range of menstrual disorders have been reported after all three of the COVID-19 vaccines - AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna including heavier than usual periods, delayed periods, and unexpected vaginal bleeding."
<br><br><b>Q. Why could people be having delayed </b><br><br>periods?
A. Dr. Ameen offers a few possible explanations: "We know that vaccines for other viruses, such as HPV (human papillomavirus) and the flu, can affect the menstrual cycle, so there could be something similar going on here." Some evidence also suggests that menstrual disruption may be happening more in the pandemic anyway, so perhaps this is all part of a bigger picture.

<br><br>In survey results published earlier this year,
researchers collaborating from the National
University of Ireland and Loughborough, Lincoln, and Nottingham Trent Universities in the UK found that more than 52 percent of women reported a change in their periods during lockdown; however, the study hasn\’t yet been evaluated by the medical community. "Cause and effect of these changes isn\’t clear cut. Whether it\’s the vaccine or stress and anxiety, it\’s hard to tell" according to Dr. Ameen.

<br><br>But there could also be something physical
going on. "The whole point of getting a vaccine is to mount an immune response. Immune cells have a role in building up, maintaining, and breaking down the lining of the womb. And it has been suggested that the chemical signals circulating after you\’ve had the vaccine may affect immune cells and, therefore, cause your period to come earlier" says Dr. Ameen.

<br><br>"Another theory is that if the vaccine causes other side effects such as fever, this can lead to an inflammatory response in the body, which can affect when ovulation takes place and, in turn, that could cause menstrual irregularity."
<br><br><b>Q. How concerned should I be about delays and changes to my period? </b><br><br>A. "The main thing to know is that the effects on menstrual cycles seem to be temporary. There don\’t seem to be signs of this being long term," says Dr. Ameen.

<br><br>"It\’s also important to remember that so far, the number of women self-reporting any impact on their periods is still quite low compared to the total number of women who have been vaccinated. If any of your symptoms persist for three months or more, see your GP or gynecologist. They may want to investigate further with scans and blood tests."
<br><br><b>Q. If I do see changes after getting
vaccinated, how should I report it? </b><br><br>
A. People should feel empowered to make an official report if they have menstrual
fluctuations after their vaccine. "There is a real lack of attention on women\’s health in general and specifically on the menstrual cycle. Reporting side effects allows us to have more data," says Dr. Amen. Dr. O\’Brien agrees: "We would support more data collection in this area to understand why the COVID-19 vaccine might be having an effect on periods. We would urge the MHRA to closely monitor the reports they gather from women to see whether the two might be linked."

<br><br>In the U.K., you can report any suspected side effects via the MHRA\’s Yellow Card scheme. In the U.S., adverse side effects can be reported through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

    <string name="Does_the_COVID_Vaccine_Cause_Heavier_and_More_Painful_Periods_">Does the COVID Vaccine Cause Heavier and More Painful Periods?</string>
    <string name="Does_the_COVID_Vaccine_Cause_Heavier_and_More_Painful_Periods_content"><![CDATA[Ever since the COVID-19 vaccination program started, some people have noticed shifts in their menstrual cycle. As of September 2021, the MHRA - the UK public body responsible for vaccine safety - has received more than 34,200 reports of post-vaccine period problems, including heavier than usual periods. That\’s following around 47.4 million doses of the vaccine given to UK women up to September 1. It\’s a relatively low percentage (0.07% based on current data), and the research to date does not support a link between menstrual changes and COVID-19 vaccines. However, this data probably doesn\’t include everyone who\’s experienced problems, because not everyone will make an official report.

<br><br>If your cycle seems different, whether it\’s more painful periods or a change in your flow, you\’re not alone. "My first period after my first jab was horrendous. My periods aren\’t great at the best of times anyway, but definitely more flow and more pain," says one user. Meanwhile, there are also users experiencing the opposite. "I noticed my period after my first jab was quite light - I\’m normally really heavy" says another.
<br><br><b>So is the vaccine to blame for heavier or
more painful periods? </b><br><br>There currently isn\’t a lot of solid evidence, but five U.S. research institutions have been given funding to look into the link between the COVID vaccines and menstrual changes.

<br><br>Any immune reaction or fever you experience with any vaccine are understood to cause short-term cycle changes, just like when you become ill from catching a cold or other illness.

<br><br>Dr. Zahra Amen, Consultant Gynecologist and Obstetrician at the Cadogan Clinic in London, explains why vaccination might impact your cycle, in theory. "The uterus lining is part of the immune system. Immune cells build up, maintain, and break down the lining of the uterus. When you have a vaccine, that causes an immune response, which can affect the immune cells circulating around your body, and this can lead to changes to your period" she says.

<br><br>However, there are a few other factors that
could cause changes in the intensity of flow and the pain you experience during your period.
<br><br><b>So could it be something else? </b><br><br>It\’s safe to say that living through a pandemic has been pretty stressful, and stress is known to lead to menstrual changes. Common conditions such as fibroids - non-cancerous tumors on the uterus - can also cause heavier bleeding during your period. So it\’s worth considering whether something else might be going on, especially if it lasts more than one cycle after your vaccine or is a particularly concerning change.
<br><br><b>What to do if you\’re worried about the
changes</b><br><br>If you feel that there\’s been a shift in your flow post-vax, don\’t panic. Keep a diary of the intensity of your flow for three cycles. "This will help you and your doctor to notice if there\’s a pattern," says Dr. Ameen.

<br><br>As for self-care, Dr. Amen advises, "Make sure you\’re getting enough sleep - seven to eight hours a night - and take medication such as paracetamol [acetaminophen] or ibuprofen to ease pain and bloating. Stay hydrated and eat small amounts often as you\’d probably rather not have three big meals a day."

<br><br>Right now, all the evidence points to these
changes being short term, so it\’s likely that you can look forward to normal service resuming in your next cycle.

<br><br>People should feel empowered to make an
official report if they have menstrual
fluctuations after their vaccine. In the U.K., YOu can report any suspected side effects via the MHRA\’s Yellow Card scheme. In the U.S. adverse side effects can be reported through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

    <string name="Is_the_COVID_Vaccine_Making_PMS_Worse_content"><![CDATA["I got my second Pfizer jab, and I\’m feeling very depressed even after the fever has gone. My PMS came a bit early. This feels as if I\’m going through something," one user.

<br><br>Their experience certainly isn\’t unique. While research to date does not support a link
between menstrual changes and COVID-19
vaccines, some experts have noticed that a
number of people have been reporting
experiencing worse PMS symptoms like mood swings, fatigue, bloating, and headaches than they did before getting vaccinated.
<br><br><b>Why might this be? </b><br><br>
"There is so much anxiety around vaccination, the virus, and the pandemic, so it is possible that the vaccine could intensify PMS symptoms such as anxiety and depression," says Dr. Nitu Bajekal, a consultant gynecologist at London\’s Royal Free Hospital.

<br><br>There\’s also an overlap between PMS
symptoms and vaccine side effects, so it can be tricky to know which factor is to blame. "It\’s not unusual to feel low or have headaches after vaccination, and these symptoms can appear with PMS, too," says Dr. Bajekal.

<br><br>But there could also be something physiological going on, which may explain
wider symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and bloating. Dr. Laura Payne, a researcher at McClean Hospital, is leading a new study looking at the link between inflammation - the body\’s defense mechanism against anything harmful - and menstrual changes post-COVID vaccine. Some vaccines may provoke an inflammatory response as part of the way they work.

<br><br>"We are looking at whether markers of
inflammation can affect estrogen levels, which, in turn, could affect the menstrual cycle. Those changes could potentially include PMS symptoms," she says.

<br><br>The evidence isn\’t clear cut right now, but
studies, including Dr. Payne\’s, are underway in five U.S. research institutions to unravel the link between the COVID vaccines and menstrual changes.
<br><br><b>Managing your PMS post-vaccine</b><br><br>
If you\’re suffering from a worse bout of PMS after getting vaccinated, there are some simple things that could help ease the symptoms.

<br><br>"Try to get a handle on stress, because this can make PMS worse. Do some deep breathing. Try to be more mindful," says Dr. Bajekal.

<br><br>Taking a walk in nature can also help. "Exercise is great because it releases feel-good hormones," she adds.

<br><br>Research has also found that upping your
intake of complex carbohydrates may be
beneficial - we\’re talking peas, beans, whole
grains, and vegetables. "A well-balanced diet that is low on ultra-processed foods is also beneficial for PMS" she says.
<br><br><b>Should I get help for my post-vaccine PMS? </b><br><br>
"If you feel that your PMS has ramped up after the vaccine, track your symptoms for two or three months to help you and your health care professional establish a pattern," says Dr. Bajekal.

<br><br>"However, if you are feeling so low that you are struggling to get out of bed, or if you\’re having harmful thoughts, don\’t ignore it. See a health care professional straight away," she says. "For most people though, intensified PMS symptoms after the vaccine are hopefully short term."

<br><br>People should feel empowered to make an
official report if they have menstrual
fluctuations after their vaccine. In the U.K., you can report any suspected side effects via the MHRA\’s Yellow Card scheme. In the U.S. adverse side effects can be reported through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

    <string name="_4_Myths_About_the_COVID_Vaccine_and_Fertility_Debunked">4 Myths About the COVID Vaccine and Fertility Debunked</string>
    <string name="_4_Myths_About_the_COVID_Vaccine_and_Fertility_Debunked_content"><![CDATA[If you\’ve ever found yourself scrolling through online theories that the COVID vaccine messes with your chances of having a baby, you\’re not alone. It\’s completely normal to feel concerned but there is a lot of false information out there.
Even if you\’re not interested in getting pregnant any time soon (or ever), you want to know that you\’re future-proofing your fertility (or just how a virus affects your body), right?

<br><br>We\’ve spoken to the experts to find out
whether four common myths about how the
COVID vaccine affects fertility and pregnancy are true or not.
<br><br><b>Myth 1: The vaccine will make you infertile</b><br><br>
Not exactly what you want to hear should you ever want a baby, is it? Dr. Randy Morris, an IVF and infertility specialist who runs the fertility clinic IVF1 in Illinois, U.S., says there are two false theories circulating around the COVID vaccine and fertility.

<br><br>The first false theory is that the antibodies your body makes post-vaccine could attack the developing placenta that\’s needed for an embryo to implant. The second false claim
relates to the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which use tiny, protective fat bubbles called lipid nanoparticles. "The theory is that these lipid nanoparticles are sucked into the ovaries, where they wreak havoc and lead to infertility" he says.

<br><br>Dr. Morris recently conducted a study
investigating the effects of vaccination on
women receiving fertility treatment. He looked at three groups of women - those with antibodies in their blood from COVID
vaccination, those with antibodies because
they\’d had COVID, and those without
antibodies. "We looked at the ability of an
embryo to implant in the uterus in each of the three groups: There was no difference between the three. We also looked at the risk for miscarriage: There was also no difference between the groups," he says.

<br><br>Dr. Zahra Amen, consultant gynecologist and obstetrician at London\’s Cadogan Clinic, stresses there is no plausible scientific reason why the components of the vaccine itself would impact your ability to conceive. These vaccines work by telling our cells to make a harmless fragment of something called a spike protein. The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID.

<br><br>"You mount an immune response so that the next time you\’re exposed to COVID, your body has a memory of how to fight it, and, therefore, you are either not infected, or your infection is much less severe. It\’s not a live vaccine. It\’s similar to other vaccines offered during pregnancy, like flu or whooping cough vaccines" she says.
<br><br><b>Myth 2: The vaccine changes your cycle and </b><br><br>
makes conceiving more difficult
While people are reporting changes in their
cycle after the COVID vaccine and studies are underway to investigate a possible link, most people who see a shift find that things go back to normal in the following cycle. "Any menstrual cycle changes are likely to be short-lived, and there is no evidence that this has an impact on your future ability to have children," Dr. Amreen says. Our cycles can change any time we get sick, have a fever, or are stressed. So these reported changes aren\’t unexpected.
<br><br><b>Myth 3: The vaccine isn\’t safe when you\’re </b><br><br>
pregnant
When the COVID vaccines were approved for use last year, at the time there wasn\’t enough evidence to advise their safety in pregnancy. But with more research being carried out, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends that all pregnant people be vaccinated against COVID, as does the CDC and all leading medical organizations that care for pregnant people.

<br><br>Dr. Amen points out that the risk to pregnant people is far greater if they get the virus. "We know that two-thirds of women who test positive for COVID in pregnancy have no symptoms, and those in the later stages of pregnancy are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID. You\’re twice as likely to have a stillbirth and twice as likely to give birth prematurely if you have COVID," she says.

<br><br>Meanwhile, there is no evidence that the COVID vaccine causes miscarriage. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found vaccinated pregnant people had a rate of miscarriage similar to the rate expected in the general population. There was also no change in stillbirth rates. Research has also found antibodies in the umbilical cord blood of pregnant people who\’ve had the vaccine. More data is needed to know exactly how this might
provide protection against COVID-19 for the
baby.
<br><br><b>Myth 4: The vaccine isn\’t safe if you\’re </b><br><br>
breastfeeding
Could COVID be passed onto a baby through breastfeeding if someone\’s just been vaccinated? No. The COVID vaccines don\’t
contain the live virus, so COVID cannot be
passed through breast milk. Studies have
shown that what people do have in their breast milk after the vaccine is antibodies that could help protect their babies. In a study reported in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, five breastfeeding parents provided frozen milk samples before and after Pfizer vaccination. The results could suggest a potential immune benefit to breastfed babies up to 80 days after vaccination, but more research is needed.

<br><br>The upshot? All the evidence and guidance out there right now indicates that COVID
vaccination is safe for your fertility - whether you\’re trying for a baby now or thinking about it in the future.

    <string name="How_Having_COVID_Impacts_Your_Cycle">How Having COVID Impacts Your Cycle</string>
    <string name="How_Having_COVID_Impacts_Your_Cycle_content"><![CDATA[If you\’ve tested positive for COVID-19, or you\’re enduring the effects of long COVID weeks or months after getting the virus, you might be seeing changes to your menstrual cycle. If so, you\’re not alone. In one study of 237 people with confirmed COVID, almost 20 percent had temporarily lighter periods or a longer cycle.

<br><br>Some users have also noticed worse
headaches, fatigue, and premenstrual
syndrome (PMS) while fighting the virus. Add to that concerns that the COVID vaccines could be triggering menstrual irregularities including delayed periods, and heavier and more painful periods, and it can all feel a bit much.

<br><br>But what do we actually know about how
having COVID can impact your cycle? We
spoke to a gynecologist and researchers who are investigating the potential link between COVID and the menstrual cycle to get the answers you need right now.
<br><br><b>Having COVID can cause a longer cycle and delay your period</b><br><br>
Dr. Zahra Amen, consultant gynecologist and obstetrician at London\’s Cadogan Clinic, says many of her patients have mentioned
a change in the pattern of their bleeding, or
a missing period, since having the virus.

<br><br>"Being unwell with COVID can be stressful, and we know that stress can have an impact on ovulation and when your period arrives. Stress can also disrupt the interaction between the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in the brain and adrenal glands on the kidneys, which all mediate our response to stress. This can affect hormones released from the brain, ovaries, and adrenal glands, and so affect the menstrual cycle. Patients may report longer cycles or missed periods in this instance," she says.

<br><br>You may also experience changes before your period arrives. "If someone has had COVID, or long COVID, their PMS symptoms may be exacerbated" says Dr. Amen. She points out that there is an overlap in symptoms between COVID, long COVID, and PMS, which can make it tricky to work out which is making the other worse. PMS symptoms include fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and feeling low and anxious and some of these symptoms can also be found in long COVID.
<br><br><b>COVID causes stress to your body, and that
stress may cause changes in your cycle</b><br><br>
Regardless of when in your cycle you notice a shift, one theory is that it could be due to
inflammation, which is the body\’s completely natural response to anything harmful that comes its way. "It\’s certainly possible that inflammation from illness - COVID or otherwise stress, or injury could affect the menstrual cycle. Inflammatory markers may affect estrogen levels, which in turn can impact the menstrual cycle. However, we just don\’t know yet if this is true, and for whom this may be the case," says Dr. Laura Payne, a researcher specializing in menstrual pain at McClean Hospital.
<br><br><b>The changes to your cycle from COVID are
likely to be short-lived</b><br><br>
The good news is that any changes to your
menstrual cycle during illness with COVID
appear to be temporary. "At the moment,
there\’s no evidence that any of these effects are long term. I haven\’t come across anyone who\’s had these symptoms for more than three or four months," says Dr. Ameen.

<br><br>So hopefully, with some rest and self-care you will be on the road to recovery very soon. However, if you are worried about changes in your cycle, or they\’ve lasted for more than three months, it\’s worth speaking to your health care provider.
<br><br><b>The best way you can help yourself (and
your cycle) is to take extra care of yourself</b><br><br>
If you\’re facing the double whammy of having COVID and being on your period, Dr. Ameen says to try to get seven to eight hours of sleep a night. And if you\’re suffering from pain during your period, take pain-relieving medication.

<br><br>"We now know that COVID can also cause
symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea," she says. "[Make sure] you\’re well
hydrated and try to eat regularly, if you can.
COVID may cause loss of appetite, but try to eat small amounts throughout the day," she adds.

    <string name="_5_Late_Period_Remedies_Fact_Checked">5 Late Period "Remedies" Fact-Checked</string>
    <string name="_5_Late_Period_Remedies_Fact_Checked_content"><![CDATA[Cast a spell under a full moon, drink gallons of parsley tea, do some intense jumping - who among us hasn\’t come across some.. unusual "remedies" for making a late period come?<br>
Before we delve into these so-called "remedies," let\’s make it clear what actually
sets the wheels of your period in motion in the first place. For anyone with a regular cycle who isn\’t using hormonal contraception, a period happens if the egg released during ovulation has not been fertilized. Basically, whether your period is early, on time, or late, it usually has to do with when ovulation has occurred (and if it
has at all).<br><br>
So, can any quick fixes actually give Mother
Nature a helping hand (or robust shove) to
kickstart your period? We explored some of the most common - and random - remedies. In the meantime, maybe just step away from your mom\’s parsley? She needs it for her cooking.
<br><br><b>Remedy 1: Hit the herbs, plants, and fruits</b><br><br>
The internet is awash with theories about what you can eat or make tea with to make your period come. And while these may sound harmless, some are best avoided.
<br><br><b>Parsley</b><br><br>
t may not be the first ingredient you think of
when putting the kettle on, but desperate times call for desperate remedies, right? Parsley has long held a reputation among herbalists as an "emmenagogue" a substance believed to stimulate menstruation (others include chamomile, cinnamon rosemary, sage, and oregano). In parsley, this may be due to two volatile oils
- apiol and myristicin - that may stimulate uterine contractions.
<br><br><i>Verdict? Fiction</i><br><br>
Supporting research is limited, and parsley
comes with a lot of warnings attached for
something we\’ve only ever used as a garnish you shouldn\’t consume large amounts of parsley tea if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, have kidney problems, or take diuretics or blood thinners. On the whole it\’s probably best to pass.
<br><br><b>Dong quai</b><br><br>
Dong quai is a plant native to China that has been used in herbal medicine for centuries and is believed to induce a period by boosting blood flow to the pelvis, stimulating the muscles in the uterus, and triggering uterine contractions.
<br><br><i>Verdict? Fiction</i><br><br>
Once again, there\’s no evidence to show that this can induce your period. But, while it isn\’t a remedy for your late period, there is some evidence it may help with PMS. That said, it\’s probably safer (and tastier) to just stick with a stuffed-crust pizza and
a rom-com.
<br><br><b>Turmeric</b><br><br>
According to Ayurvedic medicine (a millennia - old Indian medicine system that uses herbal medicines, meditation, breathing, and physical therapy to cleanse the dody and restore balance), turmeric can help regulate the menstrual cycle and induce a period.
<br><br><i>Verdict? Fiction</i><br><br>
There\’s no actual science showing golden
milk - a traditional Ayurvedic recipe which
blends hot milk with turmeric - will bring on
your period. But it has been gaining popularity as a general health-booster (turmeric latte anyone?), due to the herb\’s nutrient-rich, antioxidant qualities.
<br><br><b>Ginger</b><br><br>
Wild ginger is a traditional Chinese remedy
thought to stimulate the flow of menstrual
blood (and "chi" or life force).
<br><br><i>Verdict? Fiction</i><br><br>
Although there isn\’t much supporting evidence in terms of it jump-starting your period, there\’s no harm in treating yourself to a delicious ginger tea - it\’s linked to good gut health, which can be an issue in these PMS-y times. Pour hot water over a tablespoon of chopped fresh ginger, let it steep for five minutes, add a little honey, and enjoy.
<br><br><b>Pineapple</b><br><br>
Although we\’re not sure who started this rumor, we know pineapple is rich in the enzyme bromelain, which has a variety of effects on our blood and muscles. So, could it potentially get your blood flowing by kicking your uterine muscles into action?
<br><br><i>Verdict? Fiction</i><br><br>
This theory is all rather vague and not backed up with any real science. On the plus side, bromelain has been linked to reducing pain. And pineapple is a rich source of vitamin C and manganese as well as dietary fiber - helpful when PMS may be causing constipation - so why not have a slice or two?
<br><br><b>Vitamin C</b><br><br>
A quick web search reveals numerous articles discussing the will it/won\’t it of vitamin C when it comes to bringing on your period. The thinking is that it can affect progesterone levels, causing the uterus to contract and the lining of the uterus to break down, triggering menstruation.
<br><br><i>Verdict? Fiction</i><br><br>
Despite these relatively scientific-sounding
musings, there is no actual evidence to support them (and too much vitamin C can cause nausea and diarrhea
- the upper limit is 2000mg). If you do want to road test this method in a way that won\’t send you running for the toilet, why not up vitamin C-rich foods citrus fruits, berries, broccoli, spinach, peppers, and tomatoes are all good sources. Whatever happens, you\’ll be full up on nutrients.
<br><br><b>Remedy 2: Have a bath</b><br><br>
Rumors abound pointing to the period-
prompting qualities of a nice, hot soak. As
stress can cause periods to stop or be irregular (whether simply late or missed entirely), and baths have been shown to lower tension. But is there actually any evidence that they can make your period come?
<br><br><i>Verdict? Fiction</i><br><br>
Or, to put it in bath terms, it\’s a lukewarm-to-cold maybe. While there\’s no direct research linking baths to jump-starting a period the worst that could happen is you\’ll feel a bit less stressed. Plus, it\’s a great time to finally use that face mask you\’ve had for about three months now.
<br><br><b>Remedy 3: Do yoga</b><br><br>
Some yoga poses - think cobra, garland, and butterfly - have long been rumored to "boost reproductive health" but are they really a remedy for a late period?
<br><br><i>Verdict? Fiction</i><br><br>
There is no definite evidence. It\’s possible a
lovely, low-key restorative yoga class or some pranayama breathing may be helpful if stress is what\’s holding up your cycle. But! A long-term, regular yoga practice has been shown to ease PMS, period pain, heavy bleeding, and irregular periods. We call that a win-win (or win-yin). To be on the safe side, always consult your physician before beginning any new exercise program.
<br><br><b>Remedy 4: Have an orgasm</b><br><br>
If you\’ve ever needed a good excuse for some self-love, then this is it - having an orgasm is rumored to be helpful when it comes to coaxing a reluctant period. This is because having an orgasm causes uterine contractions similar to those caused by hormone-like substances called prostaglandins which expel the uterine lining. But in a pleasurable way.
<br><br><i>Verdict? Fiction</i><br><br> (ish)
An orgasm won\’t bring on a period that isn\’t
already on its way cyclically, as these can only be triggered by falling levels of estrogen and progesterone. But masturbation brings with it a whole load of good oxytocin-releasing, endorphin-boosting vibes, so we say knock yourself out.
<br><br><b>Remedy 5: Crank up the cardio</b><br><br>
Maybe if you get up and move around,
something might come out? Like your period?? Well, before you book that last minute HIIT class, probably not ...
<br><br><i>Verdict? Fiction</i><br><br>
Though very vigorous exercise regimes over time can affect your period the other way (with low body fat, stress, and energy expenditure affecting hormone levels and interrupting your cycle), there isn\’t any real evidence linking vigorous exercise to triggering periods. That said, exercise is a proven-stress buster, so if you\’re feeling stressed, it could be worth throwing into the mix.
<br><br><b>Are there any late period remedies that do
work? </b><br><br>
While there aren\’t really any scientifically
proven period prompters per se, there are
things you can do to help. If stress is behind your missing period, gentle exercise (like yoga), meditation, and activities that require concentration, like gardening, crafting, or baking, will help you relax. In the long term, eating well, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly can help keep your cycle regular. A low vitamin D level has been linked to irregular cycles - so taking vitamin D might also help (but you should discuss supplements with a healthcare professional before taking
them.) So, why not head off for a soak, have an early night and a quick breath-based
meditation to help you drift off, and just let
everything flow (hopefully literally). We\’ll be
here for you when you need to moan about
cramps and general unpleasantries.<br><br>
If your period doesn\’t show up and turns into three missed periods in a row - and you
definitely aren\’t pregnant (or if you\’re worried about where it\’s gotten to) - see your health care provider so they can investigate further.

<br><br>One or two days of difference is normal even for a stable cycle. A more significant change may be caused by illness, taking certain medications, significant weight changes, stress, climate changes, etc. These factors can make the egg mature earlier or later, which shifts the day of ovulation.

<br><br>What causes this pain? During ovulation, the follicle releases an egg together with a bit of fluid. This gets into the abdominal cavity lining and may cause irritation. Sometimes, this process is accompanied by spotting for 1-2 days. This happens because the rupture of the follicle can damage the small vessels that nourished it.

    <string name="How_PMS_and_Ovulation_Affect_Your_Sleep">How PMS and Ovulation Affect Your Sleep</string>
    <string name="How_PMS_and_Ovulation_Affect_Your_Sleep_content"><![CDATA[According to the National Sleep Foundation, as many as 33% of women say that their
menstrual cycle affects their sleep.

<br><br>Your menstrual cycle is regulated by hormone levels, which affect energy, fatigue, body temperature, and mood. These all impact sleep. Also, many people experience sleep disruption for several days before their period. Bloating, cramps, digestive issues, headaches, and breast tenderness can make a good night\’s sleep difficult.

<br><br>Here are some sleep strategies to help you get the sleep you need during your period and every day of the month:

<br><br>- Go to bed and wake up at the same time
every day.

<br><br>- Stay hydrated.

<br><br>- Have a relaxing, pleasant pre-sleep wind-
down routine.

<br><br>- Take a warm bath or shower 90-120 minutes before bedtime.

<br><br>- Avoid both late meals and feeling too hungry before going to bed.

<br><br>- Eliminate unwanted noise with earplugs or a sound machine.

<br><br>- Keep the room cool - around 60 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 20 degrees Celsius).

<br><br>- Avoid or limit screen time at least 1-2 hours before bedtime.

<br><br>- Get daily exercise to promote deep-sleep
stages and to ease PMS symptoms.

<br><br>- Write down your to-do list and worries early in the evening to avoid stress and anxiety at bedtime.

<br><br>- Take a 20- to 30-minute nap in the early
afternoon following a rough night.

<br><br>- Get morning light to reset your body clock.

<br><br>- Do some yoga. Child\’s pose, Legs-Up-The-
Wall, Corpse pose, Supine Twist, and Head-to-Knee pose all help you relax.

<br><br>Hormonal fluctuations affect women differently, so not every woman will experience the same cycle-related sleep issues. Practicing good sleep hygiene, especially in the week before your period, can minimize sleep disturbances. Address any sleep problems with a health care provider to better manage symptoms and rule out a medical condition or sleep disorder.

<br><br>You can track sleep disturbances to determine if they\’re linked to your menstrual cycle.

    <string name="Not_Pregnant_10_Other_Causes_of_Late_Periods">Not Pregnant? 10 Other Causes of Late Periods</string>
    <string name="Not_Pregnant_10_Other_Causes_of_Late_Periods_content"><![CDATA[On average, we have around 400 periods in our lifetimes. And since your body isn\’t a machine, of course they\’re not all going to be "on time." Some of your cycles will be longer for no other reason than a normal variation in length. In fact, as many as 30 percent of us don\’t have regular cycles. <br><br>
Your period\’s only considered "late" eight days after you expected it. If you\’ve waited longer, and it\’s still nowhere to be seen, and you\’ve ruled out pregnancy as a possible cause, you\’re probably wondering where on Earth it\’s got to. Here are 10 other reasons your period could be off-schedule.
<br><br><b>1) You\’ve exercised a bit too much<br><br></b>
Yes, working out can be great for our bodies and brains. But exercising too much (defined as strenuous exercise that burns more calories than you take in) can cause ovulation - and therefore your period - to stop. <br><br>
What counts as "too much" varies from person to person. If you\’re an extreme athlete or suspect your activity level could be affecting your period, it\’s a good time to check in with your health care provider.
<br><br><b>2) You\’ve been really stressed<br><br></b>
We all know stress can have a damaging impact on our mental health, but it can affect physical health, too. Emotional stress is pretty common in people who\’ve experienced hypothalamic amenorrhea
- a condition that causes periods to stop because the hypothalamus gland in the brain slows or stops releasing the hormone that starts the menstrual cycle. And, numerous studies have linked high levels of stress to late, missed, and stopped periods.
<br><br><b>3) Your weight\’s changed significantly<br><br></b>
A change in weight is the second-most
common reason Flo users have a late period according to data from our Virtual Assistant. Of course, it\’s natural for our weight to fluctuate, but a significant change is a known cause of late, missed, and stopped periods, as are the effects of eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. How much weight loss is "significant" enough to affect your period? Some small studies have determined it to be more than five percent of your body weight in a month, but more research into this is needed.<br><br>
With weight loss, if your body fat percentage becomes too low, you could stop ovulating because your body isn\’t producing enough estrogen. If you\’re actively trying to lose weight, it\’s always best to do so gradually (about 1-2 lb. a week). <br><br>
On the flip side, if you gain a significant amount of weight, your cells release more estrogen which can also stop ovulation and therefore, your period.
<br><br><b>4) Your time zone has changed<br><br></b>
When you pass through different time zones, it\’s not just your sleeping pattern that can get messed up (hello, jet lag!). Your cycle can change too, due to a change in your circadian rhythms, which regulate your cycle and hormones. <br><br>
If, for example, you move or travel to a different time zone and start working during the hours when your body is used to being asleep, your period can be thrown off.
<br><br><b>5) You\’ve had a change in your hormonal
contraception<br><br></b>
While hormonal contraception can be great for regulating your cycle in the long run, starting it can impact your period because it contains hormones that usually stop ovulation. A disruption like missing pills or throwing up after a pill can affect it too. <br><br>
If you\’ve recently stopped taking the
contraceptive pill, you may have a late period since it can take a little while for your cycle to find its feet again. You may also have irregular periods for the first three months while your natural cycle settles in.
<br><br><b>6) You\’ve taken emergency contraception<br><br></b>
Emergency contraception pills can make your next period arrive later than expected. But if it\’s more than seven days late, you should take a pregnancy test and consider seeing your health care provider. <br><br>
If you\’ve had an intrauterine device (IUD or coil) fitted as emergency contraception, changes to your cycle are possible. Some people who have a hormonal IUD notice their periods stop entirely over time.
<br><br><b>7) You\’re taking a new medication<br><br></b>
There are a number of medications known to cause late and missed periods in the first
months of taking them, including
antipsychotics, antidepressants, blood
pressure drugs, allergy medications, and anti- nausea pills. <br><br>
You may have also heard anecdotes of people having late or missed periods after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The reported number of temporary cycle disruptions is relatively low in relation to how many people have received the vaccine, and there currently isn\’t any data linking any of the vaccines with period irregularities, but studies are underway.
<br><br><b>8) You\’re showing signs of a gynecological
condition<br><br></b>
Conditions caused by a hormonal imbalance can lead to late, missed, and stopped periods. Polycystic ovary syndrome (POS) occurs when high levels of androgens (a type of hormone) cause fluid-filled sacs, or cysts, to grow in the ovaries. In turn, this interrupts ovulation and causes irregular and stopped periods. <br><br>
Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) can also
make the ovaries stop working before
menopause. POl affects people under the age of 40 and is different from premature
menopause, which causes stopped periods and no chance of getting pregnant. Some people with POl may still have irregular or occasional periods and may be able to get pregnant.
<br><br><b>9) You\’re showing signs of perimenopause<br><br></b>
We tend to hear the word perimenopause and freak out (mainly thanks to a general lack of education and a whole lot of stigma). The truth is, perimenopause symptoms can start in your 30s and 40s, often years before your periods actually stop. One of the first signs is a change in the length of your cycle, with some people
not having a period for months at a time. Other signs include hot flashes, night sweats, and trouble sleeping.
<br><br><b>10) You\’re experiencing another kind of
hormonal imbalance<br><br></b>
The thyroid - that gland at the base of your
neck - is responsible for producing hormones and also regulating your cycle.
A thyroid imbalance can disrupt ovulation and cause your period to be late and even stop. An overactive thyroid gland can produce too many hormones, and lead to
a condition called hyperthyroidism. Other symptoms of this are nervousness, anxiety, irritability, hyperactivity (difficulty staying still), and mood swings. An underactive
thyroid (hypothyroidism) doesn\’t produce
enough hormones and includes symptoms
such as weight gain, depression, and
constipation. Both conditions can cause late, missed, and stopped periods. <br><br>
A non-cancerous tumor in the pituitary gland (known as prolactinoma) is also
a potential cause. It makes the brainproduce too much prolactin, which can lead to a drop in estrogen levels. It\’s also the cause of 10-20 percent of cases of stopped periods. Other symptoms to look out for include milky discharge from the breasts, painful sex, vaginal dryness, acne, and
excessive growth of body and facial hair. It can be treated with medication, but surgery may also be an option.
<br><br><b>When will your period come back? <br><br></b>
Ah, the million-dollar question. If your period\’s only a few days behind schedule, there\’s likely no need to worry. A late period becomes a "missed" period after 42 days (or more than six weeks). After three months, this is known as secondary amenorrhea (an absence of periods after previously having had periods) AKA stopped periods. This is different from primary amenorrhea, which is when someone has never had a period at all.
<br><br><b>If your period is late or missed<br><br></b>
Firstly, remember not to panic. Lifestyle factors like stress and diet are the most frequent cause of late periods. Once you\’ve identified the cause, it\’s usually quite simple to make changes that will improve your cycle regularity. With travel and a change in time zone, your period should get back to normal naturally (usually within a month or two). <br><br>
However, if you think one of the conditions
above could be what\’s messing with your
period, see your health care provider to discuss it further. <br><br>
And, sorry to sound like a stuck record, but this bears repeating: The best and simplest things you can do to help keep your cycle on track are maintaining a healthy lifestyle - moderate exercise, nutritious diet, getting enough quality sleep, not smoking, and practicing stress- busting techniques like yoga and meditation.
<br><br><b>If your period has stopped<br><br></b>
Although 1 in 25 people who are not pregnant, breastfeeding, or going through menopause experience secondary amenorrhea at some point in their lives, left untreated it can cause other health problems - like osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, which are caused by a lack of estrogen. If your periods have stopped, see your health care provider so they can help you find the cause and go over your treatment options. <br><br>
It\’s highly likely you\’ll experience late, missed, or stopped periods at some point in life. Remember, if you\’re late, try to avoid stressing out (easier said than done, we know). Instead, arm yourself with knowledge about what can affect when your period comes. Know when to seek advice. And keep tracking your cycle.

mood, and other times you wouldn\'t let anyone touch you? That\'s absolutely
normal - the same goes for masturbation. And here\'s the thing: your menstrual cycle could be playing a part in all this. While everyone\'s different, there are some general rules for what each phase could spell for your sex life - and how to make the most of them ...
]]></string>
    <string name="Menstruation_Love_Hate">Menstruation = Love/Hate</string>
    <string name="Menstruation_Love_Hate_content"><![CDATA[What\'s going on right now? No prizes for
guessing: This is the stage in your cycle when you have your period. Of course, some of us get to enjoy painful cramps, backache, and other such delights.

<br><br>But others actually feel better when they see red, says Consultant in Sexual and Reproductive Health Julie Bowing from London Gynaecology:

<br><br>"The hormone progesterone peaks and troughs in the previous phase in your cycle, which can cause premenstrual symptoms. But by the time your period has started, progesterone levels have dropped and plateaued, which can ironically mean some people actually feel better once they\'re on their period."
<br><br><b>The sex effect: <br><br></b>
This phase is a bit of a mixed bag when it
comes to sex - people tend to either love it or hate it.

<br><br>"Part of the reason some people enjoy period sex may be down to the fact period blood serves as lubrication. For some women who experience dryness at other times of the month, sex may be more pleasurable during a period" explains Julie.
It\'s no wonder period blood has been
affectionately dubbed "cherry lube" by some (a nickname you\'ll probably either love or hate too).

<br><br>Of course, if you have painful periods, they may snuff out any spark of desire. Or you just might not like the idea of getting it on when you\'re menstruating, or you break out in a cold sweat thinking about bloodstains on your bedsheets. That\'s all A-OK.
<br><br><b>Up for sex? Consider this ...

<br><br>Get practical before you get wild<br><br></b>
"If you\'re having period sex (whether that\'s
penetrative, oral, or otherwise), I\'d suggest
popping a towel underneath you if you\'re on
your bed to protect your bedding, as well as
having some tissues handy" suggests
relationship and psychosexual therapist Selena Doggett-Jones from Highgate Therapy, who\'s a spokesperson for the UK\'s College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists.

<br><br>Getting it on in the bath or shower is also a
smart way to avoid a post-sex stain removal come-down.
<br><br><b>Find your comfort zone<br><br></b>
If the blood is the bit that turns you off, there\'s plenty you can enjoy while using
a tampon or menstrual cup - from touch to oral sex to non-penetrative toys. After all, your clitoris is likely a major player when it comes to orgasm ….. and it\'s still fair game.

<br><br>"If you\'re wearing a tampon, for example, your partner can easily hold the string out of the way. (If they\'re giving oral, I\'d suggest putting in a fresh tampon beforehand.) It\'s about having a conversation with them about what you\'re both comfortable with," notes Selena.
<br><br><b>Talk it over tactically<br><br></b>
Nervous about how to fit, "Want to go down on me while I\'ve got my period?" into
conversation? Selena recommends this
approach:

<br><br>"Start by talking about a third party - it might be an article you\'ve read about someone\'s
thoughts on period sex or something that
comes up on TV. Then you can use that as a prompt to ask them what they think about it. This is a technique called "signposting" that we often use in therapy, which is
a gentler way into asking a direct question."
<br><br><b>Stay protected<br><br></b>
Know this: Period sex comes with a higher risk of getting or transmitting an STI because the virus may be present in your blood, and your cervix is more open than usual. So be sure to use a condom or dental dam if you\'re having penetrative or oral sex and you or your partner haven\'t been tested for STIs.

<br><br>Be sure to wash your hands and any sex toys before and after sex, too - for most sex toys, all you need is soap and water.
<br><br><b>Go solo<br><br></b>
A study in The Journal of Sex Research
suggests pleasurable self-stimulation(AKA
masturbation) can elevate your pain threshold, so if you have period cramps, a little bit of "me time" might be in order, even if sex is off your radar.
<br><br><b>Not up for sex? <br><br></b>
Not a problem. "It\'s important to break down taboos around period sex - there is no \'wrong\' time of the month to have sex," says Julie. But, at the same time, no one should feel pressured to try it.

<br><br>Still, Selena notes that if you\'re in a relationship, "maintaining some connection is important as, for some people, if they\'re not intimate - even for a short time - they then struggle with how to start it up again."

<br><br>Think cuddles, kisses, a glass of wine ... you know, all the good stuff.
<br><br><b>Don\'t forget: <br><br></b>
If you\'re having sex that could result in
pregnancy, it is possible to get pregnant during your period. If this sounds like you and a baby isn\'t on your agenda, be sure to use contraception.

    <string name="Follicular_Phase_Feeling_Friskier_">Follicular Phase = Feeling Friskier?</string>
    <string name="Follicular_Phase_Feeling_Friskier_content"><![CDATA[Your body is B.U.S.Y. during this stretch: the
follicular phase starts when your period does (so there\'s crossover with the menstrual phase) and carries on through to when you ovulate (an egg is released from your ovaries in the hopes of finding a sperm).
<br><br><b>The sex effect: <br><br></b>
As you get closer to ovulation, your body
becomes laser-focused on getting pregnant
(even if your mind isn\'t) - so you might notice your sex drive ramping way up.

<br><br>"Nature has primed you to be more interested in sex at your fertile time. Levels of the hormone estrogen rise throughout this phase, which may cause increased libido and increased vaginal lubrication," explains Julie Bowing, consultant in sexual and reproductive health at London Gynaecology.

<br><br>Plus, research at the University of Chicago
found women were more likely to initiate sex, experience stronger sexual desire, and have more sexual fantasies in the days leading up to ovulation due to hormonal changes. Thank your ovaries for those perks.
<br><br><b>Up for sex? Consider this ...

<br><br>Hone your seduction strategy<br><br></b>
That hormone-induced libido boost might
mean you\'re up for initiating sex in theory but unsure/uncomfortable about doing it -
- or feel you\'re hitting a wall with your partner.

<br><br>"Something that often comes up with couples is that people are too subtle - one person thinks they\'re initiating sex, but the other person doesn\'t even realize," says Selena Doggett-Jones, relationship and psychosexual therapist and spokesperson for the UK\'s College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists. The key, she says, is to discuss your preferred cues. What\'s your go-to when you\'re hinting? What\'s theirs? What would you ideally like each
other to do?
<br><br><b>Not up for sex? <br><br></b>
Your body hasn\'t factored in things like juggling a job, kids, housework, friendships, finishing that series while it\'s still streaming for free, so there\'s nothing wrong with you if you don\'t want to have sex right now - no matter how much nature is egging you on.
<br><br><b>Don\'t forget: <br><br></b>
There are millions of factors that conspire to make something feel good, or not, on any one day. So Selena notes, "I encourage couples not to assume that what worked one day - for them or their partner - will work the next. The key is to keep talking."

    <string name="Ovulation_Pleasure_Peaks">Ovulation = Pleasure Peaks</string>
    <string name="Ovulation_Pleasure_Peaks_content"><![CDATA[This is the big moment, biologically speaking: An egg (usually just the one) is released from the ovaries and has just 24 hours to hook up with a sperm before it dies.
<br><br><b>The sex effect: <br><br></b>
With an egg on the loose, your body is going to do everything it can to encourage you to get pregnant.

<br><br>"About a week before you ovulate and ovulation itself is when levels of the hormone estrogen build up and reach their peak before falling," notes Julie Bowing, consultant in sexual and reproductive health at London Gynaecology.

<br><br>And higher estrogen = increased libido and
natural lubrication, she explains. "At the time of ovulation, your cervical mucus tends to become thinner and more slippery - like egg whites - which is designed to help sperm enter through the cervix. This can also make sex feel more pleasurable."

<br><br>Plus, the hit of hormones you get right now can make you feel more energized, she adds.
<br><br><b>Up for sex? Consider this ...

<br><br>Explore your boundaries<br><br></b>
If this estrogen/libido/energy peak has you in the mood to amp things up, but you\'re unsure how to bring it up with your partner, Selena Doggett-Jones, relationship and psychosexual therapist, has this advice:

<br><br>"Sometimes I give couples a list of all sorts of sexual activities and get them to say for each \'Yes, we already do it,\' \'We haven\'t done it, but I might be interested,\' or \'It\'s an absolute no-no! It\'s a good way of creating an open discussion.

<br><br>Couples could perhaps try the same idea at
home - putting lots of different sexual
activities or positions on pieces of paper in a bowl and then pulling one out in turn to discuss what they think about it."
<br><br><b>Not up for sex? <br><br></b>
That\'s totally cool - you\'re a human, not a
hormone-fueled machine (imagine!). Selena also notes: "Some people experience pain when they ovulate and can feel quite
uncomfortable." If that\'s you, it makes sense that you\'re not as game as your biology wants you to be.
<br><br><b>Don\'t forget: <br><br></b>
You\'ll often read that ovulation happens on day 14 of your cycle, but Julie notes: "People\'s cycles vary so much, so you have to be careful using that as a benchmark."

<br><br>Your best bet is to figure out when you ovulate by tracking your periods and symptoms if you want to make the most of this window.

    <string name="Luteal_Phase_Cooling_Off_content"><![CDATA[Post-ovulation, estrogen levels drop and
progesterone levels then rise before falling off again, explains Julie Bowing, consultant in sexual and reproductive health at London
Gynaecology.

<br><br>"How this affects people varies. Some might find the increase in progesterone has
a calming effect. Others find the peak in progesterone and/or the drop brings uncomfortable premenstrual symptoms such as breast soreness and mood changes."

<br><br>Oh, and a bunch of other fun stuff, like bloating, headaches, fatigue, spotty skin, and greasy hair. Good times.
<br><br><b>The sex effect: <br><br></b>
How you feel about getting it on right now will probably be determined in no small part by how many buzzkill premenstrual symptoms you\'ve got going on. "There\'s also the simple fact that you don\'t have those high levels of estrogen anymore, which tend to give you higher libido, energy, and more lubrication," notes Julie.

<br><br>However, she adds, "While, for many, hormonal changes can impact their libido and how much they enjoy sex, some people may not notice a fluctuation in their desire throughout their cycle." If that sounds like you …. congrats!
<br><br><b>Up for sex? Consider this ...

<br><br>Time it right<br><br></b>
If you find you\'re drained at this point in your cycle - but still down for getting down in theory - relationship and psychosexual
therapist Selena Doggett-Jones suggests,
"Switch up the time you get intimate. People often don\'t think of having sex in the middle of the day, but with more people working from home these days, that might be possible."

<br><br>"Or plan to have sex before dinner, after which a full stomach can make you even sleepier. It\'s surprising how exciting it can feel to change something as simple as the time of day you normally have sex."
<br><br><b>Build a support system<br><br></b>
Sore boobs? Obviously, any position where
your partner\'s resting their bodyweight on them is probably going to be a no-go, but Selena notes, "You might also find that rear-entry positions, if you\'re having penetrative sex, are uncomfortable if your breasts are left hanging and feel heavy, so you might find it helpful to use pillows as props for support or to leave your bra on."
<br><br><b>Get wet<br><br></b>
"If you feel drier at this point in your cycle, one way to improve how sex feels is to invest in a really good-quality sexual lubricant," says Julie.

<br><br>A water-based lubricant is typically a great
option. Want something more slippery and
long-lasting? Try a silicone-based lubricant.
Treat yourself!
<br><br><b>Not up for sex? <br><br></b>
Sore boobs and a raging headache aren\'t
exactly aphrodisiacs, so it\'s totally legit to take a little break.

<br><br>But if you still want to do something intimate, Selena suggests exploring non-sexual touch, taking turns to stroke each other\'s bodies for 20 minutes each (or whatever works for you).

<br><br>"Use it as a time to be creative with sensual
touch - the idea is that your motivation is to
explore, not arouse (although, of course, the latter may happen). Couples can learn they can be very intimate without having an agenda or the goal of climax."
<br><br><b>Remember: <br><br></b>
... to communicate with your partner. If you
regularly aren\'t at your best place physically
and emotionally before your period and it\'s
likely to mean sex is off the table for a while, Selena suggests, "You could think about
marking your period in a shared calendar, so your partner knows what to expect when - that way it feels less personal!"

    <string name="Learn_how_to_masturbate_really_well_with_these_masturbation_tips_content"><![CDATA[Masturbation is utterly amazing. Not only does it feel really damn good - it can also be good for you. When you orgasm, you release oxytocin, and this darling little hormone can play a part in your overall well-being. It\'s an excellent pain reliever (goodbye, cramps!), and as mentioned in Biological Psychiatry (the official journal of the Society of Biological Psychiatry), it also has the potential to decrease anxiety. We could all use a bit of that, right?
<br><br>It\'s not just orgasmic self-pleasure that could boost your health, either. During sexual excitement, your brain releases serotonin. This chemical has been found to help increase sexual satisfaction and regulate mood. Basically, self-love can offer a cocktail of brain- balancing joy. Orgasm or no orgasm. <br><br>
Whether you\'re just setting off on your
masturbation journey, or are a seasoned self- lover stuck in a bit of a rut, sex therapist Dr. Jordan Rullo, PhD, shares her expert advice on how to masturbate really well. <br><br>
Let the oxytocin and serotonin flow!
<br><br><b>Step 1: Start the desire fire<br><br></b>
There\'s a lot we get wrong about the nature of sexual desire - like the myth that we should just naturally get horny at the drop of a hat or out of nowhere. The truth is, we\'re complex creatures. And as Dr. Laurie Mintz, PhD, points out in her best-selling book Becoming Cliterate, women (and people of all genders, actually) don\'t actually experience this very often. <br><br>
In fact, according to the Journal of Sexual
Medicine, one in three of us experience
responsive desire as our predominant type of desire. This kind of desire manifests when we\'re exposed to sexual stimuli (touching, watching porn, reading erotica, whatever floats your boat) - AKA in response to something (this is also known as the Incentive Motivation Model). So, many of us need something - a little spark - to make desire happen. <br><br>
There are so many ways to do this, and what works depends on your own unique mind and body. So don\'t be afraid to get creative. "Create a context and mindset where there is no pressure to perform in any way, no expectations, no time limit, and privacy" Jordan explains. She says setting up your masturbation space with soft lighting, candles, or your favorite music can help you get in a relaxed and present headspace.
<br><br><b>Step 2: Explore your whole body<br><br></b>
"Often, sexual activity is solely focused on
genitals and breasts, but through exploration of your entire body, you may find many erogenous zones which will enhance your self-stimulation experience," Jordan says. <br><br>
You can start by massaging your legs, inner
thighs, arms, or stomach. This allows for
pressure-free exploration of sensations that
simply feel good. If you have issues with low libido, body image, or trouble orgasming, this can help you connect to your body without judgment - and unlock its potential for pleasure.
<br><br><b>Step 3: Lube up<br><br></b>
Adding extra lubricant creates a barrier
between your skin and hands, which increases sensation, reduces friction, and makes masturbation more comfortable. "Women report that lubricant increases sexual arousal, pleasure, and orgasm," Jordan says. <br><br>
She suggests going for a water-based lube with natural, non-irritating ingredients (and
preferably one that\'s free of sugar, parabens, and other harmful chemicals).
<br><br><b>Step 4: Start from the outside ... <br><br></b>
When it comes to masturbation, the clitoris is the place to focus on for the vast majority of us. It has an estimated 8,000 nerve endings! Plus, many studies have found most people need clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm. A 2017 study published in The Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy found 37% required it to orgasm (compared with 18% who said vaginal penetration alone was enough). <br><br>
To begin, lightly touch your clitoris using your finger. There are many stimulation techniques, so what feels good is totally unique to you and your body. Try: <br><br>
- Rubbing your clitoris in clockwork (or
counter-clockwork) motions

<br><br>- Rubbing up and down

<br><br>- Tracing your finger from side to side

<br><br>"Research shows that a variety of speeds,
pressures, and strokes is more arousing than the same stimulation on repeat" Jordan adds.
<br><br><b>Step 5: ... and then work your way in<br><br></b>
Vaginal penetration isn\'t everyone\'s cup of tea, but it certainly can feel good for some people. If you do want to explore penetration, it\'s important to be properly warmed up first. Repeat step 4 until you feel relaxed and ready. <br><br>
Insert one or two fingers (or a sex toy) into your vagina and hook it upwards towards your belly button, in a rocking horse motion. Explore the entire area internally by touching, rubbing, or tapping - and remember to take it slow. <br><br>
Again, lube can be a life-changer here. It can make your vulva and vagina feel slippery and more comfortable.
<br><br><b>Step 6: Try penetration and clitoral <br><br></b>
stimulation together
You can also combine clitoral and vaginal
stimulation in tandem. Use one hand to rub
your clitoris, while you explore penetration with the fingers of your other hand. <br><br>
It helps to think of pleasure exploration like a buffet. Some dishes will be amazing. Some won\'t be. Sometimes you might be interested in one dish, and other times, not so much. The point is you have a vast menu to choose from and you\'re welcome to try whatever you feel like on any given day. You deserve variety!
<br><br><b>Step 7: Be present<br><br></b>
Being able to breathe deeply into the body is crucial for relaxation and calming the nervous system. By learning how to do this, you\'re allowing your body to inhale all the oxygen and energy it needs, making you feel more present. When you exhale, your breath carries stress out of your body, allowing you to feel more grounded. This might take some practice, so don\'t worry too much if it doesn\'t work the first few times.
<br><br><b>Step 8: Tap into all of your senses<br><br></b>
Stay focused by tapping into all of your senses. Ask yourself: <i>What do I feel? What do I hear? What do I see? What do I smell?</i><br><br>
Thinking about what all of your senses are
experiencing can bring you into the moment, allowing your mind to stay present and focused on the sensations in your body.
<br><br><b>Step 9: Get some gear<br><br></b>
Yeah, we\'re talking sex toys. Vibration allows for deeper, more concentrated clitoral stimulation. If you haven\'t used sex toys before, it\'s often easier to start with something smaller like a bullet vibrator. But, if you love the idea of something bigger, go for it! (No judgment here!) <br><br>
Jordan says, "A silicone vibrator that can be
used for external stimulation (e.g., clitoral) and internal stimulation (e.g., vaginal) and provides a variety of speeds and pulsations is a great option." This is because "it gives you more options for exploration and to figure out what feels pleasurable."
<br><br><b>And remember to take your time<br><br></b>
Rushing leads to anxiety, which can dampen the experience - so be sure to set aside time to fully enjoy your self-love session. Think about masturbation as a true, bonafide sexual experience that deserves to be central to your life. The point of all of this self-love is to explore your body, enjoy sexual touch, and learn more about who you are as a sexual human. <br><br>
The more time and attention you give to your own pleasure, the better sex will be (both alone and with partners). Oh, and remember the most important thing: Have fun!

    <string name="Is_Anal_Sex_Safe_Key_Rules_to_Follow">Is Anal Sex Safe? Key Rules to Follow</string>
    <string name="Is_Anal_Sex_Safe_Key_Rules_to_Follow_content"><![CDATA[According to research, nearly 10% of sexually active women participate in anal sex. Despite being a common activity, it\'s still a fairly taboo subject. Let\'s analyze its downsides and ways to stay safe.
<br><br><b>Is it safe to have anal sex? <br><br></b>
Anal sex isn\'t just anal penetration with a penis. Anal sex can actually be performed with a tongue or fingers, or with the use of dildos, vibrators, toys, and butt plugs.
However, safe anal sex requires planning,
preparation, and open communication with
your partner because it\'s one of the riskiest
forms of sexual activity. There are multiple
health concerns associated with it, including:
<b>Bacteria: </b> Strains of bacteria such as E. coli live in the anal canal and spread easily. Even if you and your partner are both free of STIs, bacterial infections can still affect both partners. Always exercise good hygiene and remember to put on a fresh condom before switching to vaginal intercourse.

<br><br><b>Delicate anal tissue: </b> Although the skin around your anus is somewhat tough and provides a barrier against infection, the soft tissues inside the anus are thin and delicate. Penetration can result in trauma-like anal fissures or tears, and even bleeding making you more vulnerable
to viruses and bacteria.

<br><br><b>Lack of lubrication: </b> Unlike the vaginal canal, your anus doesn\'t produce a natural lubricant for sex. Therefore, practicing safe anal sex includes using some form of lubrication. Failure to do so may cause pain, injury, or bleeding after penetration.

<br><br><b>Aggravation of hemorrhoids: </b> Anal sex isn\'t
usually linked to the formation of new
hemorrhoids. However, the stretching and pushing might cause internal or external flare-ups, worsening symptoms such as itching, swelling, and discomfort.

<br><br><b>Colon damage: </b> Though it\'s rare, anal
penetration could potentially puncture your
colon and require surgery. Consult with your doctor immediately if you notice heavy rectal bleeding and abdominal pain after participating in anal sex.
<br><br><b>How to have safe anal sex<br><br></b>
With proper planning and preparation, anal sex can be a safe and pleasurable experience for you and your partner. Protect your health by following these guidelines for safe anal sex:<br><br>
<b>Be open with your partner:</b> If you\'re hoping to explore anal sex, start an honest conversation with your partner and discuss any concerns. It\'s OK to change your mind even after you\'ve decided to try something new. Sex should never make you feel embarrassed or uncomfortable.

<br><br><b>Use an enema: </b> Yes, anal sex can get messy, and there are a few different options available for maintaining good hygiene. Consider using an enema to rinse out your rectum if you think it\'ll put both of you at ease and up the enjoyment factor.

<br><br><b>Wear a condom: </b> Condoms help protect you
from most STIs during anal sex. Though
condoms don\'t take the place of regular
testing, they can be just as effective in
safeguarding your health as they are during
vaginal intercourse. It\'s important to remember to use a new condom prior to vaginal penetration to prevent the transfer of bacteria from anus to vagina.

<br><br><b>Wash your hands and trim your nails: </b>
Another way to ensure you\'re engaging in safe anal sex is by keeping your hands clean and your fingernails short. This will lessen your chances of tearing delicate anal tissues and causing abrasions or bleeding. Scrub thoroughly, including under the nails, with warm, soapy water before inserting your fingers into the anus, vagina, or mouth.

<br><br><b>Clean your sex toys: </b> Take a few moments to clean and disinfect all toys before and after anal sex. E. coli, hepatitis B, and other germs are easily spread by these objects.

<br><br><b>Use a lubricant: </b> Apply plenty of lube during
anal sex to decrease your chances of injuring sensitive anal tissues. Many couples turn to Vaseline as a convenient and inexpensive option, but it\'s not recommended. If you\'re wearing a latex condom, stick with water-based lubricants, since oil-based varieties can weaken latex and cause condoms to break. Furthermore, Vaseline and other oil-based products can ruin your sex toys and stain your bedsheets, and these stains can be tough to remove.

<br><br><b>Warm up with foreplay: </b> A brief 10- to 15-
minute period of foreplay prior to anal sex
creates a more pleasurable experience for you and your partner. It\'s particularly essential for safe anal sex as it allows your anal sphincter muscles to loosen and relax.

    <string name="Common_Causes_of_Pain_During_Sex_content"><![CDATA[Painful sex (dyspareunia) is a common
experience, regardless of sex or gender.

<br><br>Sometimes, the problem is the result of
insufficient production of natural lubrication, so the solution is getting more foreplay or using a lubricant. However, these are also common causes of dyspareunia:

<br><br>- Absence of sexual arousal and not enough
lubrication

<br><br>- Side effects of drugs

<br><br>- Allergy to clothing, latex condoms, spermicides, or douches

<br><br>- Vaginitis (inflammation of the vaginal mucous membrane)

<br><br>- Vaginismus

<br><br>- Vaginal thrush (yeast infection)

<br><br>- Infections (including sexually transmitted
infections)

<br><br>- Endometriosis

<br><br>- Ovarian cysts

<br><br>- Fibroids

<br><br>- Certain non-gynecologic illnesses and
conditions (such as irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, etc.)

<br><br>- Inflammation or skin disorder

<br><br>- Injury, trauma or irritation

<br><br>- Surgeries or medical treatments

<br><br>- Emotional factors (psychological issues or stress)

<br><br>Sometimes, none of these factors are present Instead, there might be pain at the vaginal entry, or vestibulum (that\'s why this kind of pain is called vestibular pain). Treatment for this often requires specialist knowledge and may include a combination of physiotherapy and local medications.

<br><br>If you have sex regularly and continue to feel pain, don\'t ignore it. Go to a doctor for help. Many of the above problems can be
successfully treated.

<br><br>Pain during intercourse is not always of a
physiological nature. Personal experiences,
feeling of guilt, or psychological traumas can cause it as well. In such cases, sex therapy is recommended.

    <string name="What_Causes_Vaginismus_and_How_It_Can_Be_Treated_content"><![CDATA[Vaginismus is a strong involuntary contraction of the muscles surrounding the vaginal opening. It makes any penetration (during sex, that of a medical instrument during a gynecological examination, or even inserting a tampon) painful or impossible.

<br><br>Vaginismus can appear in girls with no previous sexual experience as well as in women who have never had problems with sex before.

<br><br>The most frequent cause of this muscular
spasm is anxiety and fear of anticipated or
experienced pain. It can be caused by stress, low self-esteem, fear of pain, unsuccessful first experience (painful rupture of the hymen), as well as lack of adequate foreplay or even mistreatment by a partner.

<br><br>Generally, a doctor\'s help is needed to treat
vaginismus. Treatment includesinformation
and education about the clitoris and the vagina. It may also be recommended to apply relaxation techniques and vaginal dilators with the help of a pelvic floor physiotherapist. The dilator treatment starts with very thin dilators that are gradually replaced by dilators of increasing size. The patient who undergoes this treatment always controls the whole process.

    <string name="Can_You_Have_Sex_on_Your_Period_Pros_and_Cons_of_Period_Sex_content"><![CDATA[Some people prefer to not have sex when
they\'re menstruating; others enjoy it. The
choice is always yours, but a bit of forethought can make it safer and more enjoyable.

<br><br>You still need to use protection if you have sex during your period. There is a higher risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and a tiny (but still real) chance of getting pregnant. So, if you decide to have sex during this time, it\'s a good idea to use protection if you wish to avoid pregnancy.
<br><br><b>Pros of period sex<br><br></b>
Having sex on your period has a few advantages, including:

<br><br>- <i>Relief from menstrual cramps: </i> Orgasms
provide natural relief from menstrual pain.
During female orgasm, the muscles of the
uterus contract and release, which can offer some relief from cramps. Orgasms can also release endorphins that make us feel good.

<br><br>- <i>Shorter periods: </i> Having sex can shorten your period. The contracting of the uterus during an orgasm can speed up the shedding of your uterine lining.

<br><br>- <i>More enjoyable sex: </i> For many women, having sex during their period can be even more pleasurable than having sex at other times of the month. This is due to hormonal fluctuations that can change your libido.

<br><br>- <i>Reduced headaches: </i> According to a 2013
study, having sex during your period may
reduce migraine and cluster headache pain for some women.
<br><br><b>Things to keep in mind<br><br></b>
Although having sex on your period has certain perks, there are also a few downsides:

<br><br>- It can be messy.

<br><br>- Your cervix is more open during your period, which increases the risk of STis if you don\'t use a condom.

<br><br>- Bedding or clothing might get stained.
<br><br><b>Can you get pregnant during period sex? <br><br></b>
Although the odds of conceiving are very low during your period, it\'s not impossible.

<br><br>Getting pregnant depends on when ovulation occurs in your cycle. This varies from person to person, and for the same person, it might even vary from month to month. You can only get pregnant from having vaginal sex during your period if you ovulate early in your cycle, or if your period is longer than four or five days.

<br><br>Another consideration is the lifespan of the
sperm. Sperm can live in your uterus for up to five days. If you have intercourse near the end of your period, that sperm may still be present when you ovulate if you ovulate early.
<br><br><b>Tips for period sex<br><br></b>
If you\'re interested in getting the most
enjoyment out of period sex, these tips may be helpful:
- Open communication with your partner is the best way to find out if you\'re both interested in period sex.

<br><br>- Laying on a dark-colored towel can prevent stains.

<br><br>- Wet wipes are great for post-period sex
cleanup.

<br><br>- Tampons should always be removed before putting anything else in the vagina.

<br><br>- A latex condom will protect you and your
partner against STIs and pregnancy. Using an internal condom will make cleanup even easier.

<br><br>- Periods are usually lighter in the last few
days, so many people prefer to have sex then.

<br><br>- Cold water and hydrogen peroxide are great for cleaning up any stains that may occur on bedding or clothing.
<br><br><b>How about oral sex? <br><br></b>
If you and your partner consent to it, oral sex doesn\'t have to be off limits during your period. If you decide to go for it, you might want to focus on the clitoris. You can leave your tampon or cup in during oral sex.

<br><br>Sex can involve a wide range of fluids and
excretions, including sweat, urine, sperm, and vaginal fluids. The presence of menstrual blood shouldn\'t automatically deter you from intercourse. Research has found that anywhere from 3 to 30 percent of people have sex during their periods, so if this is something you enjoy, you\'re not alone.

If these symptoms occur every time you have sex, this may indicate a fairly rare allergy to sperm

<br><br>The symptoms can be limited to the site of

<br><br>- Edema, itching, and burning of the skin and mucous membranes

<br><br>- Redness and soreness in the genital area

<br><br>- Difficulty breathing

    <string name="Can_You_Get_Herpes_from_Kissing_Someone_Without_an_Outbreak_content"><![CDATA[Is it possible to get herpes from kissing
someone if they aren\'t having an outbreak? The short answer is yes. It doesn\'t matter if they have a herpes outbreak or not; if they are infected, they can transmit the infection to another person.
<br><br><b>What is herpes? <br><br></b>
Herpes is an infection caused by a group of
viruses known as herpesviruses. These viruses can cause disease in humans and animals.

<br><br>The total number of known herpes viruses
is 100, but only about eight can infect human beings. Out of those eight, the herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of herpes infections in humans.

<br><br>There are two types of herpes simplex virus
infections: type 1(HSV-1) and type 2(HSV-2). Most commonly, HSV-1 is associated with oral herpes, which occurs on the lips and in the mouth. HSV-1 can cause genital herpes, but most cases of genital herpes are caused by HSV-2. HSV-2 sores can also occur in other locations.

<br><br>HSV infections are usually asymptomatic: they do not cause any symptoms, and you may not know you have HSV unless you go for a checkup.
<br><br><b>How do people get herpes? <br><br></b>
Herpes is transmitted through human-to-
human contact, usually through kissing or sex. As long as there is skin-to-skin contact, a person with herpes can infect another person, even when they are not exhibiting any symptoms.

<br><br>Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 lie dormant in nerve
cells, where they can remain inactive for some time. When the virus becomes active, it replicates and becomes transmittable through saliva and other body secretions.

<br><br>This process is called viral shedding. During this period, you may or may not experience
symptoms.

<br><br>Once a person becomes infected with the
herpes simplex virus, the virus never leaves the body. As a result, an HSV outbreak may recur from time to time.
<br><br><b>Can you spread herpes without an
outbreak? <br><br></b>
If someone has a herpes infection, they can
spread it even if an outbreak has never occurred.

<br><br>Fortunately, many people who have the herpes virus never have an outbreak. If an outbreak does occur, visible symptoms such as sores and blisters will show up in the affected area These symptoms may become visible about two and a half weeks after exposure.
<br><br><b>Herpes treatment<br><br></b>
Depending on the type of herpes infection you have and its severity, your doctor may
recommend a particular antiviral treatment.

<br><br>There is no cure for herpes, but you can treat the symptoms with antiviral treatment. You can also reduce the number of outbreaks and speed up the healing process with antiviral therapy.

<br><br>Oral herpes is treated with a combination of
antiviral drugs. Your doctor may prescribe
topical and/or oral antiviral medication. Topical antiviral medication is prescribed when you have sores and blisters in the affected area.

<br><br>Genital herpes is also treated with a combination of antiviral drugs. Your doctor may prescribe topical antiviral medications if you have sores or blisters in the genital area. Your doctor may also prescribe episodic or suppressive therapy if you have genital herpes.

<br><br>Episodic therapy involves taking antiviral
medication the moment you notice the first
signs of an outbreak, while suppressive therapy involves taking antiviral medication every day to prevent the infection from recurring.

<br><br>Suppressive therapy works well for people who experience frequent outbreaks, and it also reduces the risk of HSV transmission.

<br><br>Since this approach involves taking antiviral
drugs every day, talk to your doctor to see if or when you should stop taking the medication.
<br><br><b>Herpes prevention<br><br></b>
Since herpes is spread through skin-to-skin
contact, here are some preventive measures that can help reduce the risk of getting or
spreading HSV.

<br><br>- Avoid any sexual contact with an uninfected person if you have cold sores or blisters on the mouth or in the genital area.

<br><br>- Use condoms.

<br><br>- If you share sex toys with your partner or a
friend, make sure to disinfect them before you use them.

<br><br>- If you have frequent outbreaks, use
suppressive therapy to reduce the number of outbreaks as well as the risk of transmission

<br><br>- Talk to your partner about sexually
transmitted infections and go for a checkup
together. If one of you is diagnosed with HSV, the healthcare provider can recommend measures to help prevent or reduce the risk of transmission.

<br><br>- If you are pregnant and you know you have an HSV infection, your doctor may suggest
measures that can help prevent transmitting HSV to your baby during delivery.

Your vagina might feel dry because of a decrease in estrogen levels. Estrogen maintains the moisture of the mucous membranes, and lubrication helps the vaginal walls remain healthy and elastic.

<br><br>Regardless of age, vaginal dryness can be
caused by allergies (to underwear, hygiene
products, perfume, etc.), taking certain
medications, giving birth, breastfeeding, and stress. Silicone or water-based lubricants can help.

<br><br>If you are concerned about vaginal dryness,
talk to a doctor. They can help you find a
solution. For example, they might suggest that you start taking estrogen supplements.

    <string name="Why_Does_the_Vagina_Sometimes_Make_Sounds_During_Sex_content"><![CDATA[During sex, the vagina sometimes makes
sounds that resemble whistling, chomping, or farting. This is a normal feature of female physiology.

<br><br>During sexual intercourse, the vagina is
stretched and filled with air, which is pushed out upon penetration, sometimes making
a funny sound. This happens because of the contraction of the vaginal muscles.

<br><br>These sounds are more likely to occur in
certain positions such as "doggy style" or when a woman lies on her back with her knees pressed to her chest.

<br><br>Vaginal sounds during sex are totally normal. If they make you embarrassed or uncomfortable, though, ask your partner to make circular movements during sex. You can also try training your vaginal muscles by doing 10-15 squats every day with your knees apart and compressing and relaxing the vaginal muscles for 2 minutes.

    <string name="Can_Sexual_Abstinence_Affect_Your_Health_content"><![CDATA[Regular sex is part of many people\'s lives. But most people will, at some point in their lives, go quite some time without having sex. If you find yourself in a period of abstinence (willingly or otherwise), you might be wondering if it can affect your health.

<br><br>Sexual activity has the potential to improve or maintain health on different levels, but this does not mean that you have to have sex to be healthy or stay healthy. People are very different regarding their desire for sex. Having sex without really wanting to is not
a way to improve health. Instead, find your own personal sexuality and try to live according to what you do and don\'t want.
<br><br><b>What are the possible positive effects of <br><br></b>
sexual activity?
- Immune system

<br><br>Regular sex improves the immune system and prepares the body to fight off illness by
releasing endorphins. A study reported that
saliva samples of college students who had
regular sex were found to have a higher
concentration of antibodies called immunoglobulin A, which fight the common
cold.

<br><br>- Vaginal health

<br><br>Having sex after a long break can be
uncomfortable. It can take a while for your body to become aroused and produce enough lubrication to make sex easy and comfortable. Regular sex or masturbation can keep the tissues in your vagina healthy by improving blood flow.

<br><br>- Period pains

<br><br>Some people find sex to be an excellent
remedy for menstrual cramps. The increase in endorphins caused by sex as well as the uterine contractions that occur with orgasm can both help alleviate cramps. You don\'t have to have sex to reap these benefits - masturbation can have the same effect.

<br><br>- Cardiovascular health

<br><br>If you do not have sex on a regular basis, you are at a higher risk to develop cardiovascular disease. In addition to being a source of exercise, sexual intercourse helps keep your estrogen and progesterone levels in balance, which can lower your risk of heart disease.

<br><br>- Stress and anxiety

<br><br>Having sex triggers the release of oxytocin and endorphins. These neurochemicals can help manage the effects of anxiety or stress. Oxytocin has the additional benefit of helping you sleep. If you do not have sex regularly, your body may release these hormones less often, which might make it more difficult to cope with stress.

<br><br>- Libido

<br><br>This may seem counterintuitive, but going a
long time without having sex can make you lose interest in sex altogether. Conversely for most people, the more they have sex, the more they want to have sex. Regular sex reduces stress and boosts your libido.

<br><br>- Relationship health
For many couples, regular sexual intercourse is an important way to maintain their bond. Regular sex also often opens the door for better communication. Generally, couples who have sex more often feel more emotionally attached and connected in comparison to those who do it less often.
<br><br><b>The benefits of abstaining from sex<br><br></b>
- Contraception

<br><br>Although there are many very highly effective methods of birth control available today, the only 100% certain way to not get pregnant is to not have penile-vaginal intercourse.

<br><br>- Urinary tract health

<br><br>Not having sex drastically reduces your
chances of getting a sexually transmitted
infection, and it also makes it less likely that you\'ll get a urinary tract infection.

<br><br>- Self-awareness

<br><br>Taking a break from sex in your relationships is a great way to take some time to figure out what pleases you by masturbating. If you decide to be sexually active again, you will have information you can share with a partner to make sex even more enjoyable.

<br><br>- Improved healing (emotional and physical)

<br><br>Abstaining from sex can give you time to focus on any big emotional issues you may be dealing with. Sometimes abstaining from sex is necessary after an illness or medical procedure and doing so can speed up the healing process.

<br><br>Going without sex for a long time can be
a frustrating experience if you would rather be sexually active. However, a period of
abstinence can be an opportunity for personal growth and self-love.

    <string name="Why_Can_Cystitis_Get_Worse_After_Having_Sex_content"><![CDATA[Cystitis is an inflammation of the bladder and is a common type of urinary tract infection (UTI). The main symptoms of cystitis include:

<br><br>- Pain, burning, or a stinging feeling when
urinating

<br><br>- Lower pelvic pain

<br><br>- Frequent need to urinate

<br><br>- Cloudy and smelly urine

<br><br>- Feeling unwell and tired

<br><br>Cystitis happens more often among women
because of the female urethra anatomy. The female urethra is wide and short, which makes it easier for bacteria to enter the urethra during sex and move upwards, causing cystitis. Also, the urethra and the neck of the bladder often get irritated during sex, especially if there is not much lubrication.
<br><br><b>How to prevent cystitis from having sex<br><br></b>
- Take a shower and empty your bladder before and after having sex.

<br><br>- Don\'t combine anal and vaginal intercourse.

<br><br>- Use condoms and lubricants.

does this happen?

<br><br>During orgasm, the "happiness hormones"
called endorphins are released, creating strong positive emotions. Once the peak of enjoyment is achieved, your hormones return to their initial state. After the recent euphoric spike, the decline back to normal may result in a mood drop.

<br><br>- Inflammation of the vagina and cervix.

<br><br>- Sexually transmitted infections.

<br><br>- Endometriosis.

<br><br>- Irregular oral contraceptive intake.

<br><br>Normally, this type of discharge is non-
recurrent, doesn\'t pose a health threat, and is not a cause for concern. However, if it occurs regularly and/or is accompanied by pain, you should contact a gynecologist to find out what\'s causing it.

    <string name="Tips_for_Having_Multiple_Orgasms_content"><![CDATA[Multiple orgasm means having several orgasms during one sexual encounter. Every woman has this ability, but not all of them can use it.

<br><br>Some people consider multiple orgasms the pinnacle of sexual pleasure. Getting there requires effort and practice.

<br><br>Being in the right frame of mind can be very
helpful. It is important to be attuned to the idea that such pleasure is available to you. Learning to listen to your body and explore your erogenous zones is also an important part of this process.

<br><br>Continuous arousal is one of the main
conditions for achieving multiple orgasms.
Here, a lot depends on your partner. Your
partner should not stop caressing you after
your first orgasm.

<br><br>Often after orgasm, the genitals become
sensitive and further touch becomes painful. In this case, one can stimulate other erogenous zones (the back, chest, neck, breast, and so on).

<br><br>Making the vagina more responsive is
important for reaching multiple orgasms. This can be done by training the vaginal muscles with a special technique called Kegel exercises.

    <string name="Can_You_Orgasm_in_Your_Sleep_">Can You Orgasm in Your Sleep?</string>
    <string name="Can_You_Orgasm_in_Your_Sleep_content"><![CDATA[Sleep orgasm, also known as "nocturnal
orgasm," is a combination of elevated blood
flow to the pelvic area, being relaxed, and
having "wet" dreams that increase psychogenic arousal to reach climax without any effort.
<br><br><b>Is it possible to orgasm in your sleep? <br><br></b>
Yes, both men and women may orgasm during sleep and it is perfectly normal.

<br><br>This phenomenon is mostly associated with puberty in young boys when wet dreams happen due to increased testosterone levels. However, women also experience sleep orgasms.
<br><br><b>Do female sleep orgasms happen only
during puberty? <br><br></b>
Women usually start experiencing nocturnal orgasms in their 20s and continue throughout their lives. Women are actually more likely to have wet dreams or sleep orgasms later in life.

<br><br>Achieving orgasm generally gets easier with experience and age after having regular sexual partners you are comfortable with.

<br><br>Having an orgasm while sleeping has nothing to do with sexual disorders or experiencing any sort of sexual dysfunction. In addition, nocturnal orgasms in women don\'t only happen in the case of abstinence. It may happen due to mental and physical changes coming together to create an orgasmic reaction.
<br><br><b>Reasons for orgasms during sleep<br><br></b>
A sexual dream

<br><br>A wet dream usually happens during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. During REM, the blood flow in the pelvic region increases, and the brain is perfectly primed to produce a sleep orgasm. The arousal in females is as much as when they enjoy erotic videos or masturbate. Females may wake up to find themselves aroused or still having an orgasm. This is absolutely normal and there\'s nothing to be embarrassed about.

<br><br>Too much stress or excitement

<br><br>In some cases, stressful moments reportedly produce more orgasms or wet dreams than more relaxed moments of leisure. Too much anxiety or excitement may trigger spontaneous orgasm during sleep.
<br><br><b>How to achieve female orgasms during
sleep? <br><br></b>
According to scientific research, around 37% of women will experience nocturnal orgasms by the age of 45. The women who had nocturnal orgasms tended to have them about 3 or 4 times a year.

<br><br>There are several ways women can achieve
orgasms in their sleep:

<br><br>Sleep on your stomach

<br><br>Sleeping on the stomach triggers more clitoral stimulation and is associated with increased vivid dreams.

<br><br>The chance of having wet dreams is higher if you haven\'t had an orgasm for some time and if you are really tired.

<br><br>Go to bed thinking positively about sex

<br><br>Open your mind to all forms of sexual
expression and sexuality. This helps develop positivity about sex and sexual fantasies before going to bed.

<br><br>Understand the difference between dreams
and reality

<br><br>Once a person is aware that they\'re dreaming, they can interact with and guide their dream. This is called lucid dreaming and presents the chance to get more connected to the type of dreams you have.
<br><br><b>How to prevent orgasms during sleep? <br><br></b>
It can be very challenging to influence what
you\'re dreaming about and whether you\'ll have an orgasm during sleep or not. Here are some tips you can try:

<br><br>Relax

<br><br>Sleep for 7 to 8 hours every day and get
enough exercise to keep yourself fit and
healthy. Take some time off for activities you enjoy. Find some new habits and fun hobbies to relax your body and mind.

<br><br>Avoid watching porn, especially before going to bed

<br><br>Take your mind off sexual thoughts and avoid viewing pornographic movies, images, naked pictures, or erotic TV shows. This may help to prevent orgasm during sleep.

<br><br>Sleep on the right side and not on your back

<br><br>To prevent accidental stimulation or nocturnal orgasm during the night, it\'s better to sleep on your right side and wear loose-fitting clothes.

<br><br>Nocturnal orgasm happens when on your back or on your abdomen because of the pressure on the genitals.

<br><br>Go for cold showers

<br><br>Cold showers decrease irritation and genital sensitivity and can help prevent accidental
stimulation at night. Use the washroom
frequently and get plenty of exercise to
alleviate anxiety or tension.

<br><br>Talk to your healthcare provider

<br><br>If you feel embarrassed and uncomfortable
about your nocturnal orgasms or wet dreams, consult your healthcare provider or counselor.

<br><br>Talking about nocturnal orgasm may be the
best method to make you feel more relaxed and comfortable about this natural phenomenon.

This is best for those who are ready for adventure and a little inconvenience. If a comfortable environment is crucial for you to relax, it may be better to stick to more traditional sex spots.

<br><br>Hygiene is important. Not every place is clean and safe. For example, sex on the beach can get you in trouble. Beach sand often contains pathogenic bacteria that can get into your vagina.

<br><br>Having sex while swimming in a lake or river is not the best idea either. Open water is full of pathogenic microorganisms.

experience anorgasmy. What is known is that clitoral stimulation can often lead to orgasm. But orgasm during intercourse is much less likely to occur.

<br><br>The causes of anorgasmy can be divided into three groups.
<br><br><b>Psychological<br><br></b>
- Excessive control over emotions, inability to relax

<br><br>- Low self-esteem, fear of doing something
wrong

<br><br>- Fear of getting pregnant

- Lack of certain hormones

<br><br>- Malfunctioning of the nervous and

    <string name="What_Does_Sex_Positive_Mean">What Does /"Sex Positive/" Mean?</string>
    <string name="What_Does_Sex_Positive_Mean_content"><![CDATA[Sex positivity is based on the belief that sex as an act isn\'t something that we should be
embarrassed about and neither is one\'s sexual orientation. People who believe in being sex positive respect other people\'s sexual preferences and feel comfortable with their own sexual orientation.

<br><br>These are several examples of sex-positive
behaviors:

<br><br>- Being open to discussing your sexual
preferences and dislikes with your sexual
partner.

<br><br>- Understanding and being comfortable with the fact that your partner might not want to
have sex every time you do.

<br><br>- Understanding there is a difference between intimacy and sex. There are many ways to be intimate without engaging in oral, anal, or vaginal sex.

<br><br>- Getting tested for sexually transmitted
infections whenever needed.

<br><br>- Practicing safe sex - using condoms and
dental dams to prevent sexually transmited
infections.

<br><br>- Using methods of birth control to prevent
unwanted pregnancy.

<br><br>- Getting tested for HIV and talking to your
healthcare provider about whether you are a candidate for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PReP), which is a way to prevent HIV infection.

<br><br>- Getting vaccinated for HPV.

<br><br>- Getting regular cancer screenings to prevent cervical cancer.

<br><br>- Being accepting of other people\'s consensual sexual practices, even if they differ from your own.

<br><br>- Learning your own body, how it works, how to keep it protected, and what provides you with sexual pleasure.

<br><br>- Discovering what gives you pleasure and
being open to trying new things.

<br><br>- Developing communication skills that ensure both you and your partner are getting what you desire from sex and intimacy.

<br><br>- Advocating for comprehensive sex education so that everyone knows how to have safe sex, what consent means, and that having sex is a natural part of life.
<br><br><b>What is the sex-positive movement? <br><br></b>
The sex-positive movement encompasses all individuals who believe in sex positivity. It focuses on emphasizing safe and consensual sexual activities, regardless of the activity. Each person\'s preferences are regarded as their own personal choice, without judgment.

<br><br>Sex education is another key factor in the sex-positive movement. Every individual needs to receive a comprehensive sex education to explore sex safely. Providing sex and reproductive education is also
a way to decrease the taboos that still surround sex in certain cultures and religions.

<br><br>The opposite of sex positivity is, of course, sex negativity. Sex negativity is based on the belief that sex is destructive unless it\'s practiced strictly within the confines of heterosexual marriage.
<br><br><b>Sex-positive culture<br><br></b>
The sex-positive movement has grown
exponentially, thanks to social media platforms and modern media.

<br><br>In the past, sex was a taboo topic that was
perceived as shameful and embarrassing to
talk about. But in recent years, sex has been recognized as a normal part of life that should be talked about and discussed openly.

<br><br>These positions have also helped to encourage safe sex, especially after HIV and its prevention became a part of everyday culture in the 1990s.

<br><br>While sex negativity shames people for their sexual activities, for being victims of sexual
abuse, or even for having sex for the first time outside of marriage, a sex-positive culture accepts that everyone has a right to make their own choices about their sex life.
<br><br><b>Sex-positive asexuality<br><br></b>
Sex positivity can be practiced by anyone,
regardless of their sexual orientation. This
includes the LGBTQ+ community and asexual individuals. sexuality is defined as a lack of sexual attraction towards others and having low or no sexual desire at all.

<br><br>But that doesn\'t mean that all asexual people feel the same way about sex. While some asexual people aren\'t interested in sex at all, other asexual individuals also identify as sex positive. That simply means that they\'re accepting of other people\'s sexual preferences and might be interested in learning more about them even if they\'re not interested in taking part in those activities themselves.

<br><br>You can be asexual, avoid the shaming culture, and promote a comprehensive sexual education - all parts of the sex positive culture.
<br><br><b>Sex-positive parenting<br><br></b>
Sex-positive parents seek to teach their
children - especially teenagers - about safe
sex and consent and to empower them to make their own decisions about their sex lives.

<br><br>Studies have shown that teenagers who
discussed sex openly with their parents are
more likely to wait until they\'re older to pursue an active sex life. They\'re also more likely to approach their parents with any sex-related questions they might have. Growing up in a sex-positive household also increases the likelihood that teenagers will engage in safe sex and use condoms and birth control appropriately.

<br><br>Overall, sex positivity seeks to change negative perceptions about sex and empower all individuals to take control over their bodies and their sex lives. As long as sexual activity is pleasurable and all parties enthusiastically consent, being sex-positive can lead to safer sex and more pleasure for everyone involved!

    <string name="_7_Period_Sex_FAQs_content"><![CDATA[Ever feel more turned on during your period? You\'re not the only one. Our hormones shift at this point in our cycles, so it\'s common to crave pleasure and find sex and masturbation more enjoyable. No wonder research has found 3- 30 percent of people have tried period sex.

<br><br>As luck would have it, as well as feeling great, orgasms can also relieve cramps and
headaches and could even make your period shorter. Period sex can also encourage open and honest communication with a partner, leading to a deeper connection and increased intimacy.

<br><br>So, if you want to have period sex, what should you know beforehand? We answer frequently asked period sex questions and offer tips on how to have the safest, most enjoyable experience possible.
<br><br><b>1) What Types of Sex Can I Have During My Period? <br><br></b>
Penetrative sex is still a go, but if you\'re
wearing a tampon or menstrual cup, remove it beforehand. Use a condom to reduce the risk of pregnancy and STIs if semen is in the equation. Fingers and sex toys are also safe, but if you\'re sharing toys, wash them
thoroughly or use a condom (plus, using a
condom makes cleanup faster).

<br><br>Receiving oral sex is also on the table. It\'s safe to wear a tampon (your partner could hold the string to the side) or menstrual cup during oral, as long as you stick to clitoral stimulation. Use a dental dam - a thin sheet of latex or polyurethane that creates a barrier between your vulva and your partner\'s mouth - to reduce the STI risk. If you don\'t have one on hand, you can make your own by cutting a non-lubricated condom from top to bottom.

<br><br>Masturbation - by yourself or in front of a
partner. - is one of the safest ways to have sex during your period as it can\'t lead to pregnancy or STIs. It\'s also recommended if you experience cramps - one study found solo sex can elevate your pain threshold.

<br><br>Anal (including oral-to-anal) sex during your
period is another safe option, but be sure to
use condoms or dental dams to reduce the risk of STIs.
<br><br><b>2) Can I Make Period Sex Less Messy? <br><br></b>
Period blood isn\'t harmful, but it\'s okay to want to reduce the mess (and cleanup) that can come with period sex. If your flow is heavy, try having sex towards the end of your period when it\'s likely to be lighter.

<br><br>There\'s the age-old tip of putting a towel down to catch any blood spills, but new period products have since been designed to minimize leakage. Period pants can be worn and pulled to the side. Certain menstrual discs - which are similar to cups but disc-shaped and often single-use - can be worn during penetrative sex (be sure to check each individual product description carefully).

<br><br>If you shower before sex to reduce leakage,
only wash your vagina with water - harsh
soaps and products can affect your natural pH. Sex in the shower is an option, but be aware that water can wash away your vagina\'s natural lubrication, so you may need an extra helping hand, which brings us to...

<br><br><b>5) Can I Use Lube? <br><br></b>
Lube - natural or from a bottle - may make
sex more pleasurable and reduces the risk of soreness. Period blood just so happens to double up as lubricant, too.

<br><br>However, some people will find they produce less natural vaginal lubricant during their period. If you want a little extra lube, water-based products are safe to use with condoms, dental dams, and sex toys. Silicone lube is also fine for condoms and dental dams, but may cause your silicone toys to deteriorate. Oil-based lubes should be avoided since they can increase the chances of condoms or dental dams tearing. They\'ve also been found to increase the risk of yeast infection, and petroleum jelly-based products have been linked to an increased chance of bacterial vaginosis.
<br><br><b>6) How Do I Tell My Partner I Want Period
Sex? <br><br></b>
Since there\'s still so much stigma around
period sex, talking to a partner about it may feel daunting. But remember, truly pleasurable sex can only happen if everyone is open and honest about how they feel (and what they want).

<br><br>Be prepared to share any concerns or
insecurities you have around period sex with your partner. Listen to them and don\'t make any assumptions about their views on period sex. Set boundaries that feel right for both of you - whether that\'s around the types of sex you have or the methods you use to reduce mess.

<br><br>Anxiety is one of the biggest mood-killers, so make sure you\'re both comfortable and are giving enthusiastic consent before and
throughout the experience.
<br><br><b>7) Which Positions Are Best for Period Sex? <br><br></b>
Your cervix is likely to be lower during your
period, and if you\'re bloated or have cramps, sex positions you prefer throughout the rest of your cycle may not be as pleasurable as usual. Try different positions until you find one that works for you. If penetration is uncomfortable or painful, try other types of sex such as oral, external fingering, or nipple stimulation.

<br><br>Want to avoid getting blood on your sheets? If you\'re going for the towel-on-the-bed
technique, positions where you\'re on bottom may work best. If your energy levels are low, penetrative positions such as spooning where your partner enters you from behind while you both lie on your sides - are great.
<br><br><b>8) Can I Get Pregnant If I Have Sex During <br><br></b>
My Period?
Although the odds of conceiving are low, it\'s not impossible depending on your cycle length and when ovulation occurs. Sperm can live in the uterus for up to five days, meaning penetrative sex during your period is risky if you ovulate early. If you don\'t want to get pregnant, use a condom or birth control or focus on non-penetrative sex.
<br><br><b>9) Is There An STI Risk During My Period? <br><br></b>
STIs such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV can be transmitted through period blood. And there are a number of STls that can be passed through oral sex. So, for penetrative sex, oral sex, or oral-to-anal sex, use condoms or dental dams to reduce the risk.

<br><br>Ultimately, period sex can be just as pleasurable as sex at any other time during
your cycle - you just might need a bit more
preparation and a few more accessories on
hand.

    <string name="Your_PMS_Action_Plan_content"><![CDATA[Ever had one of those days where you\'re on
edge for no reason and even your favorite jeans don\'t fit thanks to bloat? Chances are, you\'ll check your calendar and realize your period is due. If that sounds familiar, you\'re not alone 90 percent of us face some PMS symptoms such as bloating, mood changes, and breast tenderness. For many, it\'s just an inconvenience, but others experience more severe symptoms; five percent of us have Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). This is why it\'s important to learn the PMS basics (since there are still so many we get wrong, thanks to social stigma and cultural misconceptions about the condition).

<br><br>And here\'s the hard truth: Whatever the
internet tells you, there\'s no quick fix for
banishing PMS. However, there are some
science-backed tricks that can make it more manageable. Let\'s take a look at PMS remedies that actually work ...
<br><br><b>What can you do to help your PMS right
away? <br><br></b>
<b>Supplement calcium and magnesium<br><br></b>
Many supplements on the market haven\'t been researched enough to prove whether they\'ll help with PMS, but there are a few exceptions that can help with a few symptoms. For example, taking 1,200 mg of calcium a day can help reduce the physical and mood symptoms that are part of PMS. Additionally, taking magnesium supplements may specifically help reduce water retention (AKA bloating), breast
tenderness, and mood symptoms. One study in the Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research also showed that vitamin E may help reduce symptoms of PMS.
<br><br><b>Use beauty products that tackle oily skin
and hair<br><br></b>
Notice changes to your skin and hair at the end of your cycle? This is due to your hormones causing increased oil production in your skin and scalp glands, meaning greasy hair and breakouts are more common. Try tailoring your beauty routine to meet your needs on highly oily days. Opt for clarifying shampoos designed for oily hair and stock up on dry shampoo for emergencies. While skin care is personal,
creams designed for acne-prone skin may be worth trying. If you have breakouts, there are spot treatments out there that may not work for everyone, but they might help you reduce skin inflammation and speed up treatment. Products that contain tea tree oil could be another option: A study in the Australasian Journal of Dermatology found tea tree oil products helped improve mild to moderate acne.
<br><br><b>Fill your week with stress-busting activities<br><br></b>
It\'s not just skin changes - mood changes are extremely common with PMS. In the second half of your cycle when progesterone is high, you\'re less prone to aggression or low moods but the sudden dip that happens before your period can cause you to be irritable for seemingly no reason at all.

<br><br>Know that this is normal, but have some
strategies on hand. Fill your week with stress-busting activities, such as an exercise class or a mindfulness session. Surround yourself with things (and people!) that make you feel great whether that\'s wearing your favorite PJs or booking a table at that restaurant you\'ve been dying to try.
<br><br><b>Swap your coffee for herbal tea<br><br></b>
That progesterone dip that happens before
your period comes with two "bonuses" ... bloating and diarrhea. Not everyone has this, but if you do, try swapping your morning latte for herbal teas - peppermint and fennel are great options. Fennel contains a compound that relaxes spasms in the digestive tract, meaning it helps bloating and gas.
<br><br><b>Consider the low FODMAP diet to help with bloating<br><br></b>
If bloating is particularly troublesome, the low FODMAP diet (a diet that excludes certain carbohydrates that ferment in the gut) has been proven to help, with 70 percent of those who tried it noticing improvements to their IBS symptoms. High FODMAP foods include wheat, garlic, and onion, so it could be worth avoiding these at this point in your cycle - but it\'s best to do this with the support of a dietician.
<br><br><b>What long-term changes can I make to help with PMS in the future? <br><br></b>
There\'s also other changes to make which may help reduce future symptoms and make those pre-period days more manageable in the long term.
<br><br><b>Eat a fiber-rich diet<br><br></b>
While you might make a beeline for the
chocolate aisle in your pre-period days, a study published in The Journal of Reproductive Medicine found that might not be a winning strategy: Sugary foods and drinks may actually make PMS worse because they cause erratic blood sugar levels that can impact your mood. Your best bet is to eat fiber-rich foods throughout the month - think whole grains, oatmeal, brown rice, and leafy greens. These help your gut health and balance out your blood sugar.
<br><br><b>Don\'t skip the workout<br><br></b>
Heading to the gym is probably the last thing you feel like doing on the days leading up to your period, but a study in BMC Women\'s Health found that women who did eight weeks of aerobic exercise reduced both the physical and psychological symptoms of PMS. Exercise can also help you get a great night\'s sleep, which is so important because people with PMS are twice as likely to experience insomnia,
according to The Sleep Foundation, a site for evidence-based, medically reviewed
information on sleep.
<br><br><b>PMS-proof your schedule<br><br></b>
If your cycle is fairly regular, working with your PMS and planning your schedule to take into account the hardest days of the month might make your life easier. If you have flexibility in your schedule, the days leading up to your period may not be the best to begin a big work project or take a stressful trip across the country. Instead, you might want to schedule some feel-good activities, like getting a massage or a weekend of downtime. On the flip side, there are some positives to your pre- period phase: Some people find their empathy and emotional intelligence increases thanks to
rising progesterone - this hormone can also
make you more focused and able to concentrate. So plan accordingly.
<br><br><b>What can you do if premenstrual symptoms are severely impacting your life? <br><br></b>
A small percentage of people experience
PMDD, which is characterized by severe
symptoms like a marked loss of energy, feeling out of control, feeling hopeless, or having suicidal thoughts.

<br><br>Treatment for PMDD usually goes beyond
simple lifestyle changes, and some people find birth control can help: A study published by the Open Access Journal of Contraception has shown that combined hormonal contraceptive pills improve symptoms of PMDD, so you might want to chat with your gynecologist about options.

<br><br>For those struggling with physiological
symptoms of PMDD, antidepressants could
also be worth trying - that same study from
the Open Access Journal of Contraception
found that 60-70 percent of people who took selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) noticed improvements.

<br><br>Talk therapy may work alongside or as an
alternative to medication - the results of a
randomized, controlled trial, published in
Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, found that an 8-week online CBT program was highly effective at reducing the emotional burden that comes with PMDD, and it improved coping skills too.

<br><br>While it would be amazing if PMS didn\'t exist, hormonal changes are a normal part of the menstrual cycle, so it\'s best to focus on what you can do to make it easier to live with.

    <string name="_4_Ways_to_Ease_Hormonal_Bloating_content"><![CDATA[Even if you eat a healthy diet and exercise
regularly, you may find yourself wondering why a pair of jeans or skirt that fit like
a dream two weeks ago are now a little ... snug. Don\'t rush into blaming weight gain - it could actually be bloating, which is temporary, and millions of us go through it. In fact, around 70 percent of women experience symptoms, including bloating, during their cycle. To help you understand more, here\'s some of the main hormone -induced belly bloaters and solutions
to them ...
<br><br><b>1) End-of-cycle salt storing<br><br><b>
It\'s pretty common to feel more swollen than usual in the second half of the luteal phase of your cycle (which begins directly after ovulation and lasts around 14 days).

<br><br>The estrogen-progesterone combo at this time of your cycle causes a shift in the body\'s sodium levels. How exactly does it work? Your body tends to store more salt (sodium), which binds water to itself. And when this happens, your body doesn\'t excrete as much fluid as it normally would. Hello, puffiness!
<br><br><b>What you can do about it: <br><br><b>
Be aware of how much salt you\'re consuming, especially in the luteal phase of your cycle. The healthy salt intake recommendation for adults is no more than 6 g of salt (or 2.4 g of sodium), aka one teaspoon, a day.

<br><br>To know how much salt food contains, check the nutrition labels, especially when it comes to processed foods as they often have a lot more salt in them than you think.

<br><br>In case you aren\'t sure if you\'re consuming too much salt, it\'s worth tracking your cycle to see if you get that mid-luteal bloating. From there, you can figure out where you can make some changes.
<br><br><b>2) Hormone-induced hunger<br><br><b>
Whether you want to face-plant into a chocolate cake or eat all the carbs, there\'s
scientific proof that your hormones are partly responsible for the emergence of the Munchie Monster. The culprit? Progesterone, which peaks around one week before your period.

<br><br>This may be because in the second part of the menstrual cycle our bodies spend more energy, which needs to be replenished through increased calories. Cue the raging appetite and non-stop cravings.

<br><br>Unsurprisingly, our topsy turvy hormones can make us prone to emotional eating too.
<br><br><b>What you can do about it: <br><br><b>
If you want to check out the connection
between your cycle and how much you eat,
track the times when you have increased
appetite and compare them with your
cycle predictions.

<br><br>And, well, listen to your body — after all, there\'s nothing bad about having some comfort food every now and then.
<br><br><b>3) Your cycle vs IBS<br><br><b>
Around 40 percent of us have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) linked to our menstrual cycle. And studies show the biggest cycle-induced IBS symptoms are (from most to least common) loose stools, bloating, abdominal pain, stool frequency, and bowel habit changes.

<br><br>This time, it\'s due to plummeting sex hormones during the late-luteal phase and your period.

<br><br>Even folks who don\'t have IBS can have
stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, and bloating during menstruation (although bloating hits particularly hard prior to periods).
<br><br><b>What you can do about it: <br><br><b>
The truth is, IBS has been confounding experts for years, so there\'s no definitive cure. Your best bet may be to track what you eat and try to identify triggers.

<br><br>Also, talk to your health care provider. There is some evidence that prebiotic/probiotic
supplements might help, as can peppermint oil, alongside removing those dietary triggers, getting plenty of exercise, and reducing stress.
<br><br><b>4) The hormonal stress clash<br><br><b>
Scientists discovered that women who feel
stressed around two weeks before their period are more likely to experience worse physical symptoms, including bloating, and
psychological symptoms, like anxiety and mood swings, before and during menstruation.

<br><br>On top of that, hormonal fluctuations in the
week prior to your period can make it harder than usual to deal with stress. So, what does this have to do with bloating? Stress affects your gut/brain communication, meaning it may trigger bloating, pain, and discomfort.
<br><br><b>What you can do about it: <br><br><b>
Try to add more calm to your days in general, but especially around this time in your cycle when your emotions might be feeling heightened. (We recommend tracking your moods and when they occur).

<br><br>Regular aerobic exercise and yoga are
scientifically proven stress soothers, as is a
regular mindfulness meditation practice. Don\'t underestimate the benefits of vitamin N (aka nature) either - a mere 50-minute walk in a local green space can ease anxiety and feelings of negativity.

    <string name="_7_myths_that_stop_us_from_enjoying_masturbation">7 myths that stop us from enjoying masturbation</string>
    <string name="_7_myths_that_stop_us_from_enjoying_masturbation_content"><![CDATA[Petting the cat, buttering your muffin, having a ménage à moi ... masturbating is something a lot of us do - or have done - at some point in our lives. Sadly though, it can still be a bit of a touchy (see what we did there?) subject.

<br><br>As sex therapist Dr. Jordan Rullo, PhD, explains, this is because we\’re still dealing with the negative impact of societal attitudes towards masturbation that err more towards the "sin against nature" vibes of the 19th century than the "you do you" approach we\’re leaning towards these days.
"It\’s not that women aren\’t masturbating - over 78% of women have self-stimulated - but there are lots of myths and misconceptions, and we can struggle to feel good about it" she explains.

<br><br>"Unfortunately, many women are taught from a young age that touching their genitals is disgusting or shameful. Add a lack of sex education around the subject, and it\’s a perfect storm for feelings of embarrassment and shame that can prevent us from enjoying this healthy, pleasurable part of life," she adds.

<br><br>So, let\’s look at some of the most pervasive and harmful masturbation myths (and how to overcome them). And then you can get on with dialling the rotary phone shame-free.
<br><br><b>Myth: It\’s gross to masturbate<br><br>
Truth: Masturbation is normal<br><br></b>
"Sometimes this message forms the moment a little girl is seen touching her genitals and is scolded, being told it\’s \’wrong\’ or \’dirty\’ to do so," says Jordan. Over time, comments from family members, peers at school, or people online can teach us that anything to do with our genitals (including how they look and smell) is bad, gross, or shameful.

<br><br>We know it can be really hard to overcome this negative messaging, but as Jordan points out, it\’s vital that we do. "We need to learn to like our bodies for our own happiness and self-esteem, as well as helping us have healthy, fulfilling sexual relationships," she says.

<br><br>So where do you even start? By building touch into your day, during your shower, or before you sleep at night, Jordan says. "Do this mindfully, focusing on the sensations you experience warm, cool, rough, smooth, firm, and soft. By being with your body in this non-judgmental way, you may feel more self-connected and comfortable with exploration and pleasure."
<br><br><b>Myth: Masturbating is bad for you<br><br></b>
 <b>Truth: It can actually benefit your health<br><br></b>
Again, this myth stems from negative messages around our bodies, which teach us that the fluids they produce - from discharge to menstrual blood and arousal fluid - are unclean. But the truth is: Our vaginas are wonderfully clever, self-cleaning organs; all these secretions should be celebrated as part of a natural, normal cycle; and masturbating comes with a wealth of health benefits.

<br><br>As Jordan explains: "When you masturbate,
you boost blood flow to your genitals, so the tissues stay healthier and function better. Masturbation can also lead to orgasm, which can boost mood (due to dopamine release); alleviate stress and anxiety (due tooxytocin); manage pain (due to the pain-relieving effect of endorphins); and boost sleep (due to a surge in prolactin). It can strengthen your pelvic floor, which can make orgasms and sex better."

<br><br>Plus, this flood of released hormones causes the brain to light up in the cortical, subcortical, and brain stem regions. This helps keep our brains healthy by boosting blood flow and delivering nutrients and oxygen. Masturbation\’s a serious no-brainer, basically.
<br><br><b>Myth: There\’s a right way to masturbate<br><br></b>
 <b>Truth: It\’s about finding your way<br><br></b>
Just like we all enjoy different types of sex
from slow, steady, and gentle to fast and
furious or good old missionary - there\’s no one way to masturbate. It\’s about what works for you. This myth is partly due to a lack of information on the subject that\’s rooted in misogyny, which leads to a one-size-fits-all approach when masturbation is explored: the classic gently rub your clitoris in slow circles.

<br><br>Jordan agrees: "Exploration is key. Often,
masturbation emphasizes the clitoris and
vagina, but spend time trying different kinds of stimulation all over your body - breasts, neck, thighs, buttocks."

<br><br>It can also be helpful to think of what you enjoy during sex so if you like penetration and clitoral stimulation, recreate this by using both hands or a sex toy.

<br><br>And experiment with fantasy. As Jordan
explains, "Physically stimulating your genitals is only half the equation. There\’s a very strong mental component - your mind needs to feel relaxed, present with the sensations in your body, and open to feeling aroused." By fantasizing about a person, sexual scenario, or both as you touch yourself, your arousal can build. This helps you stay in the moment.

<br><br>Try building up a reference library - a literal
"wank bank" - of erotic scenarios, from books, TV, films, or your imagination that you can draw on.
<br><br><b>Myth: It\’s wrong to masturbate if you\’re in a relationship<br><br></b>
 <b>Truth: Masturbation can make your partnered sex better<br><br></b>
"There\’s a myth that if you masturbate, then
you won\’t want to be sexual with your partner" says Jordan. "But women who masturbate have actually been found to be more in tune with their sexuality, more sex-positive, and have better sexual desire." Research published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine also reveals that people who incorporate the behaviors and techniques they use during masturbation into their sex lives are more likely to orgasm with partners.

<br><br>It can also help if you and a partner have
differing libidos. "Most heterosexual
relationships experience what\’s called
a\’desire discrepancy, meaning one partner has higher sexual desire than the other" Jordan says. "Masturbation can be an easy way to manage this imbalance. Masturbation and sex shouldn\’t be an either/or. They can function well together
and help create a healthy sexual relationship."
<br><br><b>Myth: You should only masturbate alone<br><br></b>
 <b>Truth: Mutual masturbation can be <br><br></b>
a positive shared experience
This is another myth that stems from shame around masturbation - the idea that it\’s not something you should do, much less share with a partner. This can also be linked to a lack of confidence about our bodies, what we enjoy sexually, and how we look when we masturbate.

<br><br>However, as Jordan explains, if you can gently work towards overcoming these issues, masturbation can be an extremely positive partnered experience. "It\’s not only very physically arousing, but because it may feel vulnerable, it can be very emotionally arousing," she explains.

<br><br>Many people touch their clitoris during penetrative sex because vaginal penetration alone isn\’t enough to reach orgasm for over 80% of us. Giving this a try could be an easy way to introduce a masturbatory element into your sex life. Build up from there first to showing your partner what you enjoy, then (if and when you feel comfortable) a full mutual masturbation session.
<br><br><b>Myth: You shouldn\’t talk about masturbating: <br><br></b>
 <b>Truth: Getting real about masturbation <br><br></b>
smashes taboos
OK, it\’s not necessarily something to break out at the work morning meeting, but the only way to really break a taboo is to talk about it openly. So at your next wine night with your friends, why not whip this article out SHAMELESS PLUG ALERT and see where the convo takes you?

<br><br>At the very least, they\’ll learn some new
phrases for "clicking the mouse," which is a
solid win in anyone\’s book ...
<br><br><b>Myth: There\’s something wrong with you if
you don\’t like masturbating<br><br></b>
 <b>Truth: Self-love isn\’t everyone\’s cup of tea
and that\’s okay! <br><br></b>
With sex-positive chat about the joys of
masturbating growing ever louder on social
media and in our social circles, if you\’re
someone who isn\’t especially into it, you may feel like you\’re missing out on something. But paddling the pink canoe just doesn\’t float everyone\’s boat. So if that\’s you, don\’t worry!

<br><br>"Masturbation is like any physical activity that brings pleasure yoga, swimming, running. Some people like these activities; some don\’t," says Jordan. "About 10% of women have never masturbated, and many have only tried it once. There\’s nothing wrong with how much you enjoy - or don\’t enjoy - masturbation. However, I do think it\’s incredibly important that everyone explores and becomes familiar with [their] genitals. They\’re an important part of your body, whether you masturbate or not, and by experimenting with touch, you may discover
something you enjoy."

<br><br>So, whether you\’re a regular diddler, an
occasional dabbler, or masturbation is just not on your to-do list at all, challenging and
unlearning these myths can help you love your body in all its glory. Go forth and explore!

    <string name="The_inside_scoop_on_period_poop">The inside scoop on period poop</string>
    <string name="The_inside_scoop_on_period_poop_content"><![CDATA[Oh hey, toilet - again! It\’s perfectly normal to
find yourself in the bathroom more than usual around the time of your period, but it\’s not always the whole bleeding thing that\’s to blame. For some of us, our poop gets
a little funky around this time too. But why does it happen? Well, in short, along with cramps, tender breasts, and a whole host of other fun symptoms, our cycle can also affect our bowels, specifically, how fast or slow they work. Let\’s dive into all things period poop (hypothetically, of course).
<br><br><b>How common is it? <br><br></b>
You might not feel comfortable chatting about period poop with your friends, but we\’re confident there\’s a good chance you\’re not the only one noticing a change in your bowel behaviour before or during your period. According to a study published in BMC Women\’s Health, when Canadian researchers asked 156 women to fill in a premenstrual poop and pain diary (now there\’s a fun way to spend your day),
a whopping 24% of women documented diarrhea before their period, and 28% noticed loosened bowels during menstruation. And that\’s not even accounting for constipation, experienced by 15% before and 10% during their period.

<br><br>So, who\’s most likely to experience these (not) wonderful variations of period poop? Well, sadly, if you\’re familiar with painful periods, you\’re also most likely to face these types of bowel changes. Some of us get all the good stuff, eh? Not only that, but if you\’ve got irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease, you may notice symptoms increase around the time of your period, but this isn\’t the case for everyone.
<br><br><b>So why exactly does my cycle affect my
bowels? <br><br></b>
Well, for a few different reasons ... First up:
<br><br><b>Prostaglandins<br><br></b>
You might know these as the chemicals that trigger the uterus to contract and help shed its lining, so you get your period. As
a result, they may also trigger the bowel to pass stools more quickly or cramp more frequently. Prostaglandin levels are also linked to heavier periods, which is why you might notice bowel symptoms are worse on days when your period is heavy.
<br><br><b>Estrogen and progesterone<br><br></b>
Estrogen and progesterone may also play a
role. Bowel transit time (the amount of time it takes to pass a stool once it enters the gut) seems to slow down when estrogen levels are lower and progesterone levels are higher, aka the hormone combo you experience pre-period. As a result, some people find they develop constipation and symptoms of bloating before their period starts.

<br><br>Falling estrogen also affects levels of
a chemical called serotonin. You might know it best for its mood-boosting properties, but serotonin also plays a part in the gut. There are at least seven different types of serotonin receptors in the gut, and your bowel movements will depend on which ones are activated. Some will speed things up, creating looser and potentially more frequent stools. Others will slow things down, triggering constipation and bloating.

<br><br>The good news is, if you experience any of
these symptoms, they are a normal reaction to changes in your body. But that doesn\’t mean they\’re any less uncomfortable, so let\’s talk about what you can do to make experiencing them easier.
<br><br><b>What can I do about it? <br><br></b>
This all depends on what kind of bowel
movements you\’re experiencing, so use our
handy guide below to find the tips most
relevant to you.
<br><br><b>If you poop more ... <br><br></b>
- Limit foods and drinks that further aggravate the bowels. Spicy food, caffeine, and artificial sweeteners can all trigger the bowels to move faster and are best avoided.

<br><br>- Medication, like ibuprofen, decreases
prostaglandins, so you may notice taking it for period cramps also helps with loose stools. However, this might not be suitable for everyone, so check with your health care
provider or pharmacist first.
<br><br><b>If everything\’s backed up ... <br><br></b>
- Stay hydrated; the looser your stools are, the easier they are to pass.

<br><br>- Fiber may help - it increases the size of the stool, which can encourage the body to pass it. (Just be mindful that some people find that fiber irritates their bowels, so if you\’re more sensitive to feelings of bloat or pain around menstruation, you might find that some types of fiber aggravate things further.)

<br><br>- Try to go when you feel the signal to poop.
Holding things in can cause more water to be drawn from the stool, which then makes it harder to pass next time you get the urge to go.

<br><br>- Exercise is known as a bowel stimulant, so keep moving!

<br><br>- Avoid relying on laxatives ... unless they have been prescribed by your health care provider. If you do need some help moving things along, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology suggests bulk-forming laxatives these increase moisture in the stool to plump it up, which triggers the bowel sensors to get things moving. Psyllium is an example of a bulk-forming laxative.
<br><br><b>If everything is more sensitive<br><br></b>
Increased sensitivity might mean you\’re more aware of sensation from the gut around your period - this can lead to increased feelings of bloat or abdominal pain. The tips above on keeping stools moving and avoiding gut irritation can help here, but if the pain or discomfort interferes with your quality of life, you might want to consider gut-focused hypnotherapy. This has been shown to help dial down signals from the gut in people with IBS and may also help with premenstrual sensitivity. It may also be a good idea to limit
gas-producing foods like beans and legumes or carbonated drinks during the premenstrual week.
<br><br><b>When to see your health care provider<br><br></b>
Hopefully, some of the above tips help, but if any of your symptoms affect you living your life, it\’s best to speak to a medical professional to rule out any undiagnosed gut problems. Specific things to look out for include:

<br><br>- Severe cramps accompanied by diarrhea
(sometimes a symptom of endometriosis)

<br><br>- Blood in the stool (always needs to be
investigated by a medical professional)

<br><br>- Symptoms that last longer than your period

    <string name="_7_Reasons_t_Love_Your_Discharge_Because_It_Is_Magical">7 Reasons to Love Your Discharge (Because It Is Magical)</string>
    <string name="_7_Reasons_t_Love_Your_Discharge_Because_It_Is_Magical_content"><![CDATA[Did you know your discharge is magical? Yes, magical. Perhaps not "pulling rabbits out of hats and turning wands into bunches of flowers" magical, but on a biological level, discharge is pretty wondrous stuff. It has all sorts of useful functions, clever qualities, and actually-quite-life-changing purposes.

<br><br>However, like many magical aspects of our
bodies, discharge isn\’t something that gets a huge amount of love/appreciation/woohoo noises. Instead, it\’s usually regarded with the general "embarrassing, ew" type of attitude society tends to have for bodily secretions (particularly those emanating from vaginas). One study published in Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care found that almost two
thirds of women were bothered by their
discharge, with one in five believing there was something wrong with it.

<br><br>The truth of the matter (bangs fist on table
because this is important) is that discharge is something all of us experience. It\’s completely natural and normal. What\’s more, it\’s essential for boosting our health, giving us info about our cycles, communicating problems, and generally
keeping our vaginas and cervixes feeling
fabulous. Here are just some of the magical
qualities and functions of discharge (and how tracking yours can help you pull off some pretty neat tricks of your own) ... disappears in a puff of smoke.
<br><br><b>1) It keeps your vagina clean and healthy<br><br></b>
Discharge (and cervical mucus, a specific type of discharge) is a combination of fluid and cells that your body starts making at puberty. This is then shed through your vagina. It\’s mostly water, but it also contains microorganisms called lactobacilli that help maintain the pH of the vagina (it\’s slightly acidic if you were wondering). Discharge keeps your genitals clean and healthy by removing dead cells from the lining of the vagina.

<br><br>It also helps protect against infection by
preventing the growth of unhealthy bacteria
(which can\’t flourish in an acidic environment) making everything from yeast infections and urinary tract infections (UTIs) to bacterial vaginosis (BV) less likely. People with low levels of lactobacilli can also be more prone to contracting STIs like chlamydia and HPV (among others).

<br><br>All in all, those are some pretty strong reasons to be Team Discharge from now on!
<br><br><b>2) It tells you when something\’s wrong<br><br></b>
Yep, consider your discharge a high-tech, early warning system you don\’t have to buy or install. If an infection does manage to get past the lactobacilli guards (as we\’re now calling them) and general pH defenses, your discharge will sound the alarm and then some.

<br><br>Normal vaginal discharge is clear or white and has an inoffensive smell. The amount, color, and consistency of discharge varies throughout your cycle, from thick and sticky to clear, wet, and stretchy, depending on your levels of estrogen and progesterone.

<br><br>However, if you have an infection, your
discharge quickly changes to let you know
trouble\’s afoot in Vaginaland. Key signs from your discharge include a change in the odor, amount, consistency, and color, as well as itching or pain.
<br><br><b>3) It highlights when you\’re fertile<br><br></b>
Which is helpful whether you want a baby or are 100-per-cent-absolutely-definitely-hell-no NOT trying to get pregnant. During your fertile window (the five days before ovulation and the day of ovulation itself), estrogen levels are at a high. So your discharge changes from white, sticky, and thick to a wetter, clear, and stretchy substance that looks like raw egg whites. This means you\’ve got a handy indicator as to whether to go to town on the conception front or be ultra-careful, double up on contraception, or skip the whole sex thing for a few days.
<br><br><b>4) It\’s a lovely natural lube<br><br></b>
Thanks to its consistency, discharge also works to keep the vagina lubricated. This helps prevent soreness, itching, pain, and discomfort. And it makes UTIs less likely.

<br><br>Discharge is different from arousal fluid, which occurs reactively when your body experiences sexual arousal or stimulation, increasing blood flow to the vaginal walls and causing fluid to pass through them that makes the tissues wet. But the cervical mucus you produce around ovulation can have a similar effect, due to its wetness, slipperiness, and volume.

<br><br>High levels of estrogen and a testosterone
spike at this time can make some people feel more sexual and easily aroused. For those of you, it\’s pretty much a five-day lube jubilee (luiblee? anyone?!).
<br><br><b>5) It looks really pretty<br><br></b>
Seriously - look at slides of cervical mucus
(especially around the time of ovulation). It\’s like a beautiful line drawing of delicate, florid ferns. A high concentration of salt is what makes this "ferning" happen. Blowing up one of these images and framing it will not only attract compliments from visitors (yay), it\’s also probably the best, most appropriate way to celebrate discharge in all its magical beauty.
<br><br><b>6) It can help people get pregnant<br><br></b>
This is all thanks to a sudden shift in
consistency and volume around ovulation
- When discharge becomes thinner, wetter, more slippery, and copious. This helps sperm travel through the cervix, uterus, and
uterine tubes to the egg.

<br><br>Cervical mucus also filters out abnormal sperm and helps store the "good" sperm for later release. It\’s basically a multitasking potion that you made yourself!
<br><br><b>7) And it can help protect babies<br><br></b>
In contrast to the thinner, wetter mucus that
helps facilitate conception, discharge during pregnancy is thicker, and there\’s more of it. This can help prevent infections from traveling from the vagina to the uterus. Research into preterm birth has revealed that the cervical mucus of those in the low-risk category was stronger, making discharge part of a healthy pregnancy.

<br><br>How\’s that for magic?

    <string name="_5_Things_You_Need_in_Your_Sex_Toy_Starter_Kit_content"><![CDATA[It\’s thought that around 65% of women in the U.S. own a sex toy, and with less than 20% of us reaching orgasm through penetration alone, it\’s no surprise really. But if you haven\’t used one before, it can be difficult to know where to start. You\’ve got vibrations, pulsations, penetration, clitoral stimulation - it\’s easy to be overwhelmed! The good news, this huge variety means there really is something out there for EVERYONE. So grab your favorite lube and buckle up, we have much to discuss.
<br><br><b>The bullet<br><br></b>
Did you know the clitoris has around 8,000
nerve endings? Basically, it deserves some
attention, and there\’s no better place to start than with the humble bullet.

<br><br>It\’s simple to use; just hold it in place wherever you want pin-pointed pleasure. For a different sensation, play around with the positioning try it vertically and horizontally, or for a bit of a tease, try using it on your labia, thighs, and even nipples before heading straight for the clitoris. Light some candles and take it slow, go for a cheeky quickie whenever you get a spare moment, or use it when you\’re not in the mood for penetration .. just don\’t let the bullet\’s cute
little exterior fool you - this toy packs a lot of punch.
<br><br><b>The wand<br><br></b>
An oldie but a goodie, a wand took first place in the The New York Times 2021 review of the best vibrators, making it a fairly safe bet if you\’re new to the sex toy scene. It might look a little intimidating at first, but trust us, it couldn\’t be easier to use.

<br><br>First released in the \’60s as a "neck-massager", it wasn\’t long before its hidden powers were discovered. And powerful it is - much more so than any other type of toy. The wand covers a much wider surface area, so you can achieve all sorts of orgasms. Hold it in place on your clitoris, vaginal opening, or any other body parts in need of some TLC. Most wands are rechargeable but also come with a handy plug - in option, so you\’re never disappointed by a dead battery when the mood strikes.
<br><br><b>The clitoral sucker<br><br></b>
Around 90% of your clitoris is hidden away,
which means the 10% you do see is just the tip of the pleasure-inducing iceberg. And this, friends, is where clitoral suction comes in.

<br><br>Designed to replicate the feeling of oral sex, the general principle with these beauties is that they don\’t make direct contact with your clitoris. Instead, this toy sucks and puffs air out so you experience waves or surges of clitoral stimulation - essentially vibrations of equal intensity that spread across the whole clitoris instead of just one point - for a sensation unlike any you\’ve ever felt before. The result? A slower, more intense buildup of an orgasm that makes the most of your whole clitoris. Thank you, modern technology.
<br><br><b>The rabbit<br><br></b>
It might be old school, but the great thing about this classic is that it allows you to try out clitoral stimulation, penetrative stimulation, or - if you\’re feeling frisky - both at the same time. The rabbit gives you the power to choose exactly what you need and when, making it a great tool for exploring what you like best if you\’re just starting to test the waters.

<br><br>Speaking of waters, many rabbits are now
waterproof, so you can also take them with you into the shower or bath. Between this and the dual control aspect (letting you switch up the speed and vibration of both the shaft and the ears), what more could a newbie wish for?
<br><br><b>Lube<br><br></b>
If you don\’t have some already, lube is possibly the most essential item for your starter kit. Can you masturbate without it? Technically, yes ... but for maximum pleasure and comfort, we would say no.

<br><br>In terms of the best type of lube, we
recommend water-based and one with organic, non-irritating ingredients …. It\’s less likely to irritate skin, washes off easily, and you can use it for sex as well as masturbation. If you only have another type of lube on hand, here are some words of warning. Anything silicone-based shouldn\’t be used with a silicone sex toy because it can degrade the surface of the toy, and definitely don\’t use oil-based lube with condoms - it can cause the condom to break, rendering it ineffective. Basically, spare yourself the confusion and just go for water-based lube!
<br><br><b>Bonus advice: Looking after your new toys<br><br></b>
Before you go, a quick note on cleaning your sex toys. The primary reason for this is, of course, to keep you safe and ward off
infections. (Masturbation is meant to be fun, so let\’s keep it that way!) But also, if you\’re investing in a collection, you\’ll want to make sure to get enjoyment and (let\’s be honest) orgasms out of it for years to come!

<br><br>First things first, we recommend only buying toys made of non-porous materials like silicone, metal or glass as they\’re much easier to thoroughly disinfect. Most of these can be cleaned with soap and water, but make sure to always read the instructions that come with each toy. Some have electrical components that can\’t get wet, while others can be thrown in the dishwasher - who knew?

<br><br>Hopefully, this Sex Toy Starter Kit has given you plenty of inspiration and ideas to get started on your self-love journey. So take your time, explore new things, and enjoy some much-needed you time. You deserve it.

    <string name="How_to_Navigate_Your_Period_When_You_re_Trans_or_Non_Binary">How to Navigate Your Period When You\’re Trans or Non- Binary</string>
    <string name="How_to_Navigate_Your_Period_When_You_re_Trans_or_Non_Binary_content"><![CDATA[Having a period can be a tricky thing to
navigate when you\’re trans or non-binary.
Whether that\’s because you can\’t find a period product that works for you (so much pink and gendered language!), or you\’re taking gender-affirming hormones that affect your cycle. Maybe getting your period makes your gender dysphoria (the distress felt when your gender identity doesn\’t match the sex you were assigned at birth) harder to manage. Maybe it doesn\’t at all ... there is no "right" way to feel about it.

<br><br>Whatever your experience, here you\’ll find
expert advice on how to navigate your period when you\’re trans or non-binary.
<br><br><b>1) Find the best period product for you<br><br></b>
It\’s true that period products have (historically) come in very gendered packaging. But now, many companies use gender-neutral language and avoid hyper-feminine branding. Some have removed gendered symbols altogether. So, if gendered products make you feel dysphoric, know that you will be able to find a brand that meets your period needs (with a quick internet search). And with such a wide range of period products now available, you can choose depending on your unique needs and preferences. Let\’s look at the options ...
<b>Tampons: </b> These soft, cotton or rayon-based products are inserted into the vagina to absorb blood. Tampons must be changed every 4-8 hours, and they cannot be felt while in use. You may find this helps you forget that you are on your period.

<br><br><b>Menstrual cups: </b> These flexible cups made of rubber or silicone are folded and inserted into the vagina like a tampon, and they catch period blood as it flows from the uterus. They can be used for 6-12 hours. You\’ll then need to empty, wash, and reinsert it.

<br><br><b>Pads: </b> Unable to use insertable period products (or just don\’t like them)? Pads - rectangles of soft material that stick to your underwear and absorb period blood - are a great alternative. They need to be changed every six hours or so, and you can buy both disposable and reusable (washable) pads.

<br><br><b>Period underwear: </b> With an absorbent gusset that soaks up blood the same way a pad does, period underwear is reusable and washable. The underwear needs to be changed after about 6-8 hours, depending on your flow and how absorbent the particular product is. This means having multiple pairs is best. Period underwear comes in a range of styles and colors to suit your needs: from boxer briefs and shorts to high-waisted, full-coverage underwear.
<br><br><b>2) Learn how gender-affirming hormones
can affect your period<br><br></b>
If you\’re considering gender-affirming
testosterone therapy (or if you\’ve already
started), learning how this may impact your
period can help you be prepared for this phase of your cycle.
<br><br><b>When will your periods stop? <br><br></b>
After starting testosterone, it generally takes up to three months for your periods to stop. Some people, however, may still experience breakthrough bleeding. This "is mostly seen in those patients who are not taking an adequate or fully-optimized dose of testosterone" say gender-affirmative health care specialist Dr. Adrian Harrop and consultant endocrinologist Dr. King Sun Leong. They add that bleeding is most common in the first few months of treatment "while your body is adapting to the changes in your internal hormone balance."

<br><br>Sometimes, taking very high doses of
testosterone can actually result in periods
restarting because the excess testosterone
gets converted back into estrogen. This is
because, as Dr. Harrop and Dr. Leong explain, "a person\’s body can only use so much testosterone at any one time." If you have any unexpected bleeding, they say it\’s best to discuss this with your doctor or the gender-affirmative care provider who\’s prescribing your hormone therapy.
<br><br><b>What happens if you stop taking hormones? <br><br></b>
If you have been taking testosterone and
decide to stop, Dr. Harrop and Dr. Leong say
that "in general, a person who has been taking testosterone at an optimized dose would normally expect their periods to resume after a few months of not taking it." It tends to take longer for periods to return for people who have been on testosterone for longer. They add that in some cases, particularly in older patients, periods may not return at all.
<br><br><b>Can you still get pregnant if you\’re taking
hormones? <br><br></b>
Be aware that you can still become pregnant if you\’re taking testosterone. A 2015 study published in Obstetretics & Gynecology found that 61% of pregnant trans men and non-binary people surveyed had used testosterone before becoming pregnant - and of these pregnancies, a quarter were unplanned. So, it\’s important to keep using contraception if you\’re having sex that could result in conception (and want to reduce the risk of an unplanned pregnancy).
<br><br><b>3) Take care of your mental health<br><br></b>
Of course, not every trans and non-binary
person who menstruates will feel dysphoric
about their period. "Every trans person has a unique relationship to their body" says Jack Doyle, a trans health advocate. "[That means] there\’s a wide range of feelings about periods, and transness isn\’t defined solely by dysphoria."

<br><br>If you do experience dysphoria during your
period, there are some practical steps you can take to protect your mental well-being.
<br><br><b>Make gender affirmation part of your routine<br><br></b>
Doyle recommends building gender affirmation into your routine "like planning gender-affirming outfits, being around other trans people, and cutting out potential dysphoria triggers like social media." Doyle says this can help you feel more like yourself.
<br><br><b>Manage your period pain<br><br></b>
Painful periods aren\’t just physically painful
they can also trigger gender dysphoria. Jessee Lovegood, an associate marriage and family therapist who works with trans and non-binary teens, says that to ease symptoms like cramps, "it can help to set reminders to take supplements or pain killers or [use] a heating pad or hot water bottle."

<br><br>Having a pain-free period can help youmfocus on things that can distract you from dysphoria, such as your favorite self-care activities.
<br><br><b>Lean on your support network<br><br></b>
Tapping into a supportive network of trans and non-binary people and allies is also useful. Talking to others about your shared experience can help with feelings of isolation and loneliness.

<br><br>"Having a community helps us learn about
options for dealing with problems that we may not have been able to come up with alone and to have people to help us feel heard, seen, and understood," Lovegood explains.

<br><br>These support networks could be in-person
(through friends and local support groups) or online forums and social networks - whatever works best for you.
<br><br><b>And finally ... <br><br></b>
If you do find your dysphoria is heightened
during your period and you\’re struggling to
cope on your own, reach out to a gender-
affirmative care provider for support. There are also many incredible LGBTQ+ charities and organizations that you can speak to. From The Trevor Project, Trans Life Center, and LGBT National Center in the U.S., to Mermaids and Gendered Intelligence in the U.K., these resources are open and accessible to everyone.

    <string name="What_LGBTQ_People_Need_to_Know_About_Birth_Control_content"><![CDATA[With so many types of birth control out there, choosing one that works for you - and your unique situation - may feel a bit overwhelming. After all, there are so many valid reasons you might want to use birth control. Luckily, there are lots of effective options for people of all genders and sexualities to try. But how do you cut through all the noise and work out which one might be a good fit?

<br><br>First, think about what you actually want to get out of your birth control. Are you after a short-term solution, or would you rather have something that lasts longer? Do you still want to have a period, or would you rather not? Would a non-hormonal option work better for you? These are all important questions to ask yourselt.

<br><br>Next, read Flo\’s guide to the most popular
options for LGBTQ+ people and how they work. And lastly, once you have a clearer idea of your options, speak to your health care provider. They\’ll be able to answer any further questions you may have and set you off on the first step of your birth control journey.
<br><br><b>So, who actually needs to take birth control? <br><br></b>
Well, anyone who wants to. It\’s really that
simple. But there are many myths about which LGBTQ+ people don\’t need to, explains queer sexual health practitioner Amy Smith, who runs the inclusive sex education platform Rethinking Sex.

<br><br>For example, if you\’re a trans man or non-
binary person taking testosterone therapy (T), you may have heard you can\’t get pregnant. But a small study by Boston IVF found trans men who froze their eggs while transitioning via T had similar egg yields to cisgender female patients. Research in Obstetrics and Gynecology also found 61% of pregnant trans men and non-binary people surveyed had used T before becoming pregnant. Of these pregnancies, a quarter were unplanned.

<br><br>Of course, preventing unplanned pregnancy
isn\’t the only reason you might want to use
birth control. People also use it to control their cycles, stop their periods altogether, or to manage hormonal imbalances and acne,
among countless other reasons.
<br><br><b>Your birth control options<br><br></b>
Don\’t know where to even begin? Here\’s an
overview of your options to get you started.
<br><br><b>Long-acting contraception<br><br></b>
Long-acting contraception Long-acting reversible contraception (or LARC) is what Smith calls "fit and forget" birth control.
LARCs are "fitted" (inserted) by a medical
professional and provide birth control for an extended period - allowing you to "forget"
about them until they need to be replaced.
There are a few types of LARCs to choose
from.
Implant: The contraceptive implant can be
used by anyone who has ovaries. It\’s a small, plastic rod that\’s fitted into the upper arm, just under the skin. Once it\’s in, it slowly releases the hormone progestogen into your bloodstream. This can prevent pregnancy by stopping ovulation, thickening cervical mucus, and thinning the lining of the uterus. It lasts for three years and is more than 99% effective. It doesn\’t contain estrogen, can be removed at any time, and shouldn\’t cause too much interruption to your cycle once removed.

<br><br>IUD/1US: The hormonal intrauterine device
(IUD), is also known as an intrauterine system AKA IUS, or coil. It\’s a T-shaped piece of plastic that needs to be inserted into the uterus by a doctor. It releases progestogen, which works in the same way as the implant to prevent pregnancy. It\’s 99% effective and can last between three and seven years. It\’s common to feel a bit of discomfort after insertion.

<br><br>Non-hormonal IUD: This non-hormonal
version of the IUD (also known as the copper coil) is also inserted into the uterus, but it uses copper instead of progestogen. The copper changes the cervical mucus and makes it more difficult for sperm to reach the eggs during ovulation. This option is more than 99% effective and can last between five and 10 years. However, some people may experience longer, heavier, and more painful periods.
<br><br><b>Contraceptive pills<br><br></b>
They\’re the most common form of non-
permanent contraception, but there are many different types, and it may take a bit of trial and error to figure out which one is best for you. Side effects can include depression, anxiety, longer periods, and low sex drive. These can vary depending on your body and the type of pill you take. Some people don\’t experience any side effects at all. "If you are on any puberty blockers or HRT, then be sure that your health care provider or sexual health practitioner is aware," says Smith.
Combined pill: For women, trans men, and
non-binary people who have a uterus, the
combined pill is an option. Using a combination of artificial estrogen and progestogen, it works by stopping ovulation, thickening the cervical mucus, and thinning the lining of the uterus. Some versions of the pill have a built-in seven- day break in each packet. This causes withdrawal bleeding that\’s similar to a period.

<br><br>Progestogen-only pill: If you can\’t use
contraception that contains estrogen, your
doctor may recommend the progestogen-only pill (also called the minipill). This pill is taken every day without breaks, and it prevents pregnancy in the same way the combined pill does. To be effective, it needs to be taken within a small window of time. So, if you choose the minipill, be sure to carefully read the instructions and make sure you take it on time. If you do, it\’s more than 99% effective.
<br><br><b>Barrier methods<br><br></b>
Barrier methods - which are non-hormonal
include condoms, internal condoms
(sometimes called femidoms), and dental dams (a piece of latex put over the vulva or anus during oral sex to create a barrier). When used properly, they are effective at preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
<br><br><b>Birth control and STIs<br><br></b>
Though some LGBTQ+ people aren\’t at risk of pregnancy, it\’s still important to take steps to have safer sex and protect yourself from STIs. "You should use external contraception just in case," Smith says. "Condoms can be used on penises and sex toys to prevent the spread of STIs, and dental dams can be used for vulvas when giving oral sex." Condoms and dental dams should also be used for anal and oral-to-anal sex.
<br><br><b>And remember ... <br><br></b>
It\’s all about figuring out which option works best for you and your unique situation. Some people strike it lucky the first time, but don\’t give up if the first option you try isn\’t a good fit. "Working out the right form of birth control for you can take some time" says Smith. "It can be a journey for some."

<br><br>Medical professionals can\’t always know which option is going to work best for you until you try it - but they can use their expertise to take all of your preferences, goals, and any potential worries into account when helping you decide.

<br><br>So, if you notice a change in mood or physical well-being after starting the pill (or any birth control for that matter), speak to your health care provider. Some side effects may get better over time, and they may encourage you to try it for a little longer if you\’re comfortable doing so. If not, they will take another look at your options with you and help you find an alternative you\’re truly happy with - because birth control is meant to make your life easier, after all.

    <string name="How_to_Have_Safer_Sex_If_You_re_LGBTQ_">How to Have Safer Sex If You\’re LGBTQ+</string>
    <string name="How_to_Have_Safer_Sex_If_You_re_LGBTQ_content"><![CDATA[Hey! So, you want to have safer sex? That\’s
great news! Everyone deserves a fulfilling sex life that\’s as safe as possible. Of course, safer sex isn\’t just about reducing the risk of passing on sexually transmitted infections (STIs), although this is a super important part of it, obviously. If you can communicate openly with your sexual partners about your boundaries and expectations, your sexual experiences will be all the more pleasurable for it, too.

<br><br>But before we get into that ...
<br><br><b>What should you know about STIs if you\’re
LGBTQ+?<br><br></b>
The first step to safer sex is learning which STIs you could be at risk of getting (and passing on).

<br><br>Most sex education classes are still so focused on heteronormative and penis-in-vagina sex that it\’s no wonder so many LGBTQ+ people don\’t know if the kind of sex they\’re having comes with any STI risks. "People just don\’t think about sexual infections being transferred through manual or anal sex, says gynecologist Dr. Sarah Yamaguchi. "All STIs can be transmitted through oral, manual, and anal sex, which is why they\’re called STIs and not penetrative infections or vaginally transmitted infections."

<br><br>In short: All types of sex between partners of all genders carry the risk of transmitting STIs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and HIV. This is because most STIs live in bodily fluids. And these can be transferred during any type of sex, not just penetration.

<br><br>So, how can you minimize your STI risk?
<br><br><b>5 steps for safer sex<br><br>
1) Use barrier methods<br><br></b>
Barrier methods of protection can be used for all types of sex. They include latex gloves (for fingering/manual sex); dental dams (thin sheets of latex or polyurethane that create a barrier between the vulva or anus and the mouth, used for oral and rimming); and condoms (for oral and penetration), and they\’re great for reducing
the risk of passing on STis between sexual
partners.

<br><br>Handy tip: If you don\’t have access to dental dams, you can make your own by cutting a
non-lubricated condom from top to bottom.

<br><br>If you have any cuts or abrasions on your hand, Conger says using latex gloves or finger cots (basically a glove for just one finger) can significantly reduce the risk of passing on STIs.

<br><br>And when it comes to anal sex, condoms or
dental dams are a must for safer anal play
- aS is anal-safe lube, which can reduce the risk of cuts or tears. Conger says it\’s also important to remember that if you\’re having unprotected oral-to-anal sex (that\’s rimming, to you and I) or giving a blow job to a partner whose penis has been used in unprotected anal penetration, there\’s a risk of an E. coli infection for you. It\’s not technically an STI, but using condoms or
dental dams can reduce that risk too.
<br><br><b>2) Get tested<br><br></b>
While using barrier methods can reduce your risk of passing on STIs, it\’s still important to get tested. "Get tested regularly if you have new partners in your relationship landscape - or one of your partners does to minimize the risk of a more serious STI going undetected, Conger explains.

<br><br>Fortunately, getting an STI or sexual health test isn\’t a big deal. Most STIs can be tested for with a swab or a blood/urine test that\’s
relatively quick and pain-free. Remember,
there\’s nothing to be ashamed of. If it helps,
remind yourself that talking openly about safer sex actually challenges myths and stigmas about it.
<br><br><b>3) Protect your sex toys<br><br></b>
If sex toys play a part in your sex life, Conger suggests using barrier protection methods with toys in the same way you would with all types of sex. "Put a condom on a dildo or use a dental dam over an egg vibrator" she says. And most importantly: "Never use toys both vaginally and anally, as this can cause infection."

<br><br>You should also always thoroughly clean
a sex toy before and after using it. "Any sex toy that\’s around the bodily fluid of another could introduce infection to you,"
Dr. Yamaguchi says. She suggests washing your sex toys with warm water and gentle soap. "Treat your sex toys like you would sensitive hands. Don\’t use harsh chemicals, since you don\’t want them to transfer to you and irritate your skin."
<br><br><b>4) Talk to your partners<br><br></b>
It\’s no secret that communication is the key to better sex, but it\’s also the key to safer sex. "If you cannot trust your partner to tell you truthfully if they\’re with other people, then no matter how careful you are, you\’re still going to be exposing yourself to risk," Dr. Yamaguchi says. Finding a partner you trust - whether for a purely sexual relationship or a committed romantic relationship will mean you can have safer (and more enjoyable) sex.

<br><br>And Conger agrees. "Safe sex is knowing your boundaries and having the tools to
communicate them well with a partner that you trust" she adds.
<br><br><b>5) ... and to the experts<br><br></b>
There are so many amazing LGBTQ+ inclusive platforms and advocacy groups that can give you safer sex advice and support, from American Sexual Health Association for general safer sex advice to Terrence Higgins Trust, a leading HIV charity.
<br><br><b>And finally ... <br><br></b>
While no sex can ever be totally risk-free,
taking ownership of your sexual health and
communicating openly with your partners can reduce the likelihood of passing on STIs. Remember, most STIs are easily treatable if they\’re detected early on. So if you\’re enjoying an active sex life, be sure to follow these steps and get tested regularly.

    <string name="From_Sperm_Donors_to_IVF_Becoming_an_LGBTQ_Parent">From Sperm Donors to IVF: Becoming an LGBTQ+ Parent</string>
    <string name="From_Sperm_Donors_to_IVF_Becoming_an_LGBTQ_Parent_content"><![CDATA[Whether you\’re thinking of starting your own family or aren\’t sure of your family planning
options as an LGBTQ+ person, you\’re probably wondering where to start.

<br><br>Well, the good news is that there are lots of
fertility options available to you.

<br><br>Check out our roundup of the most common choices, approximate costs, and resources for more info below. After that, you may find it helpful to make an appointment with an LGBTQ+-inclusive fertility specialist to figure out the right path for you.

<br><br>The price tag attached to starting a family can be a huge obstacle for many LGBTQ+ people. In the U.S., family-building grants are available from organizations like Baby Quest Foundation. Men Having Babies also provides financial assistance to gay men and trans women through their Gay Parenting Assistance Program.

<br><br>Some other sources of information on funding and treatment options include Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (U.K.), Rainbow Families (Australia), and Sherbourne Health (Canada).

<br><br>Now, let\’s get into your options.
<br><br><b>1. Egg fertilization with a sperm donor<br><br></b>
One option for cis women and people with a uterus and ovaries is to fertilize your eggs with donated sperm. As for where the sperm comes from, it can either be from somebody you know or from an anonymous sperm donor.

<br><br>If you go the anonymous route, your donor will be someone who has donated their sperm to a sperm bank. You can choose whether you want insemination (AKA the process of transferring specially washed semen into the vagina or uterus) to happen at home or at a fertility clinic.

<br><br>-Cost: It\’s as little as $25 per attempt when
done at home with a known donor. But having the sperm tested medically is recommended, which pushes up the cost by about $300. A 0.5 cc vial of anonymous sperm can be up to $300-$1,500. Usually, more than one vial of sperm is needed in each menstrual cycle you try to conceive.
<br><br><b>2. Intrauterine insemination (IUl) <br><br></b>
IUl is often jokingly referred to in TV shows as the "turkey baster method." It involves
injecting sperm into the uterus during ovulation using a soft catheter (don\’t worry
- no needles involved in this injection!).

<br><br>According to Reproductive Facts, IUl is usually the first option for LGBTQ+ people who want to have a baby because it\’s significantly less expensive than other options, like IVF and surrogacy.

<br><br>On the downside, it\’s also less effective.
According to the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Authority, success rates for IUl are generally around a third of those for IVF.

<br><br>-Cost: $250 to $4,000 per cycle
<br><br><b>3. In vitro fertilization (IVF) <br><br></b>
IVF has quite a few steps. In a nutshell, you
start by taking hormonal medication to
stimulate your ovaries to produce more eggs than your cycle normally produces. Then, the eggs are surgically removed from the follicles in your ovaries during what\’s called an egg retrieval or egg collection

<br><br>Next up, the eggs are fertilized with sperm in a dish to create embryos. Those embryos are grown and nurtured in a lab until they\’re ready to be put back into the uterus during a fresh embryo transfer.

<br><br>You can also freeze embryos to transfer later, which is known as embryo cryopreservation.

<br><br>-Cost: $12,000-$15,000 per fresh embryo
cycle, plus an additional $1,500-$6,000 for
medications. Frozen embryo transfers (FETs) average $4,000-$7,000 per cycle. If an egg donor is needed, costs can increase by up to $30.000.
<br><br><b>4. Reciprocal IVF (R-IVF) <br><br></b>
If you\’re planning pregnancy with a partner,
there\’s an option that Briana Rudick, MD, who directs Columbia University Fertility Center\’s Third Party Reproduction Program, describes as "really special."

<br><br>Reciprocal IVF (R-IVF) means one partner
donates their eggs to make embryos for the
other to carry. So one partner is the genetic
parent, and the other partner is the biological parent. Pretty amazing, right?
R-IVF is also an option if you\’re trans or non-binary and undergoing hormone replacement therapy, but you may need to go through some preparatory procedures.

<br><br>Trans men and non-binary people with ovaries can undergo egg retrieval while on
testosterone therapy (T), or they can pause
their treatment. They can then choose whether to fertilize their eggs right away or freeze them for use at a later date.

<br><br>Rudick explains that trans women and non-
binary people with testes "should freeze sperm before taking estrogen since this can suppress sperm counts. If they have already started, it can take 3-6 months for sperm counts to recover."
-Cost: $3,000-$8,000 in medication for both
partners per cycle, on top of standard IVF
costs.
<br><br><b>5. Surrogacy<br><br></b>
If, for whatever reason, you or your partner
can\’t or don\’t want to carry a baby, then it
could be worth looking into surrogacy.
A surrogate is someone who carries a baby on your behalf.

<br><br>There are two types of surrogacy:

<br><br>-Traditional, when IUl is used to inseminate the surrogate\’s egg with sperm

<br><br>-Gestational, when IVF is used to fertilize your or your partner\’s egg with sperm, and then the embryo is implanted into the surrogate\’s uterus.

<br><br>Gestational surrogacy is the most popular
method. But it\’s important to note that
gestational surrogacy isn\’t available in every U.S. state. Many surrogacy agencies, including Creative Family Connections, have interactive maps showing where gestational surrogacy is available for LGBTQ+ people and where it isn\’t.

<br><br>Though surrogacy is very popular and legally recognized as ethical in the U.S., seeking legal advice is highly recommended.

<br><br>-Cost: Gestational surrogacy costs start at
around $60,000 and can reach $150,000 or
more. Traditional surrogacy costs vary
dramatically, but the fees tend to be lower than gestational since IVF typically isn\’t used.
<br><br><b>6. Adoption, fostering, and co-parenting<br><br></b>
If the above options aren\’t right for you, there are even more possibilities to consider. These include adoption, fostering, and co-parenting (which is when two or more people without a romantic relationship team up to conceive and parent a child together).

<br><br>Similar to the other pathways to parenthood on this list, costs and regulations will vary
depending on where you live. To learn more,
you can visit the Child Welfare Information
Gateway (U.S.), the NHS (U.K.), Rainbow
Families (Australia), and the Adoptive Families Association of BC (Canada).

<br><br>-Cost: Foster parents usually receive a stipend from the government to cover some of their costs. Adoption fees can range anywhere from $15,000 to $50,000, depending on the type of adoption.

<br><br>Costs for co-parenting arrangements will
depend on how the child is conceived. Getting legal advice is essential to make sure everyone\’s rights and roles are clear, so be sure to include legal fees in your financial plans.
<br><br><b>The takeaway<br><br></b>
LGBTQ+ people have every right to fulfill their dreams of raising a child - or children - so don\’t let anybody tell you otherwise.

<br><br>"I have had so many LGBTQ+ patients in tears at their graduating pregnancy ultrasound telling me that they never thought this was possible for them," Rudick says. "They never thought they could be parents or have a family because they were LGBTQ+. I just say, \’It is possible, and you are doing it. So there.\’ "

    <string name="Heat_and_Cold_on_Your_Belly_Do_s_and_Don_ts_content"><![CDATA[Heat is one of the most effective ways to
relieve lower abdominal pain. Heat relaxes the abdominal muscles and accelerates blood flow to the organs. Placing a hot-water bottle or a towel soaked in hot water on your belly or taking a warm bath can significantly ease cramps.

<br><br>There are a few key things to remember
though:

<br><br>- Apply a heat source for no longer than 15
minutes.

<br><br>- Make sure the pain is not due to an illness or disease, gynecological or otherwise. If it is, heat may make the condition worse.

<br><br>- Heat is not always useful during your period: increased blood flow may increase bleeding during heavy menstruation.

<br><br>It\’s not recommended to apply cold when
experiencing pain in the lower abdomen caused by your period or PMS. Cold narrows the blood vessels, which can make the pain worse.

reducing the intensity and duration of pain.

    <string name="Self_Massage_for_Immediate_Pain_Relief_content"><![CDATA[Spend about 20 minutes on yourself, and you might feel the difference! Abdominal massage is a self-healing technique that can help relieve your cramps.

<br><br>It can also improve digestion, reduce
constipation by relaxing muscles, and soothe your abdominal area.

<br><br>Research shows that abdominal massage can even alleviate menstrual bleeding and the discomfort that can come with it.
<br><br><b>How to perform abdominal self-massage<br><br></b>
1. Lie on your back.

<br><br>2. Rub your hands together to warm them, then apply essential oils (you may need to dilute them).

<br><br>3. Overlap your hands on the lower part of your belly.

<br><br>4. Use your palms to massage the entire
stomach area in a clockwise direction. Repeat several times.

<br><br>5. Massage the centerline of your abdomen, beginning just below your sternum. Move
downward, ending at the pubic bone.

<br><br>6. Continue the same movement on the left
side of the centerline, in one-inch intervals,
moving downward. Do the same on the right side of the centerline.

<br><br>7. Use your fingers to press your navel firmly.

<br><br>8. Circling outward from your navel, continue in a clockwise, circular motion.

<br><br>9. If you have trigger points that need extra
attention, go ahead and focus on them.
<br><br><b>Why is abdominal massage more effective
with essential oils? <br><br></b>
Some oils may have unique properties that
enhance the practical effects of the massage. They may also help you relax.

<br><br>Many essential oils are very potent and should be diluted with a carrier oil, such as sweet almond or olive oil, before application to prevent a reaction. One or two drops of
essential oil per teaspoon of carrier oil is a good ratio to start with.

<br><br>Here are the most effective oils for massage:

<br><br>- Cinnamon

<br><br>- Clove

<br><br>- Rose

<br><br>- Lavender

<br><br>Apply the oil to a small patch of skin a day
before your massage. This gives you a chance to see if you have a reaction. If the oil causes irritation, choose another blend.

<br><br>Giving yourself an abdominal massage with
essential oils may lessen cramps and decrease the discomfort associated with having your period.

<br><br>If you don\’t feel comfortable giving yourself a belly massage, a massage from a licensed massage therapist may provide some relief.

    <string name="Kinesio_Tape_for_Pain_Relief">Kinesio Tape for Pain Relief: How, Why, and When to Use It</string>
    <string name="Kinesio_Tape_for_Pain_Relief_content"><![CDATA[Inexpensive and easy to use, Kinesio tape has been shown to help relieve dysmenorrhea in at least three different studies.
<br><br><b>How does it work? <br><br></b>
Kinesio tape is effective against period pain
because it stimulates the cutaneous nerves
(which provide nerve supply to the skin) and
increases blood flow and lymphatic circulation
to the area it\’s applied to.

<br><br>It also reduces the level of inflammation and
decreases the tension of the skeletal muscles
and the smooth muscles of the internal organs.
In other words, Kinesio tape helps to "trick" the
body into not feeling cramps.
<br><br><b>Applying and safely removing<br><br></b>
Made of latex-free, lightweight cotton, Kinesio tape has an acrylic adhesive that stretches over the skin.

<br><br>You can apply it in a number of different
patterns.

<br><br>Usually, taking into consideration the most
common location of menstrual pain, it\’s applied in a cross shape to the lower abdomen. However, it can be applied across the lower abdomen or lower back area as well.

<br><br>Kinesio tape is waterproof and designed to act like a second skin, so it can stay on as long as you wish. However, doctors will typically recommend leaving it in place for a minimum of 24 hours.

<br><br>Removing Kinesio tape is easy: simply tap or hold down the exposed skin with your finger as you pull the tape off with the other hand. Alternatively, Kinesio tape can be rolled off the skin.
<br><br><b>When shouldn\’t Kinesio tape be used? <br><br></b>
Given its noninvasive use and lack of side
effects, Kinesio tape is generally tolerated by most people.

<br><br>However, there are some contraindications to using it:

<br><br>- Allergic reaction

<br><br>- Open wounds

<br><br>- Overall sensitivity

<br><br>The presence of any of these conditions is
reason to stop use and consider an alternative method of treatment.

<br><br>If you have any concerns about the
effectiveness of Kinesio tape, we recommend you consult your doctor.

    <string name="Acupressure_to_Relieve_Cramps">Acupressure to Relieve Cramps</string>
    <string name="Acupressure_to_Relieve_Cramps_content"><![CDATA[Acupressure is a healing technique based on traditional Chinese medicine, and
a variation of acupuncture that does not involve needles. The hypothetical biologically active points on your body are instead stimulated by the fingers.

<br><br>While there\’s no definitive link between
acupressure and a reduction in cramps, it also hasn\’t been ruled out as a potential remedy and results depends on the individual. Unlike acupuncture, acupressure typically does not produce serious side effects, making it a safer alternative.

<br><br>To ease the pain and discomfort of cramps, try pressing lightly (not forcefully) on these points for 1 to 3 minutes:

<br><br>- On the belly: First, 2 finger-widths below
your belly button. Second, 4 finger-widths
below your belly button.

<br><br>- Inner shin: Between 2 and 2.5 inches (or 5 to 6 centimeters) above your ankle.

<br><br>- Back of the palm: The webbed area between your thumb and pointer finger, about 1 inch (or 2.5 centimeters) inward.

<br><br>- Groin: In the middle of the inguinal folds on the right and left side, where the thighs meet the abdomen.

<br><br>These techniques are a form of self-massage which, in and of itself, could lessen the pain of cramps, regardless of any connection to specific body points.

    <string name="Herbs_as_Natural_Pain_Remedy">Herbs as Natural Pain Remedy</string>
    <string name="Herbs_as_Natural_Pain_Remedy_content"><![CDATA[There are many herbs that act as natural
painkillers for cramps, headaches, or other
PMS symptoms during your period.

<br><br>- Ginger tea and dill help quell nausea
associated with severe cramps.

<br><br>- Raspberry leaf tea has anti-inflammatory
properties that reduce cramps.

<br><br>- Chamomile tea has stress-relieving and
sedative properties that may ease cramps and help with sleep.

<br><br>Herbs are gentle on the body, and though they contain powerful medicinal chemicals, they act slowly.

<br><br>If you prefer natural medicine to store-bought medication, know that herbs don\’t always work as quickly. You may have to take your herbal tea or capsules a few days before your period starts to get the most benefit from them.

<br><br>Always check with your doctor for any
interactions or contraindications.

    <string name="Can_an_Orgasm_Make_Cramps_Disappear_content"><![CDATA[First things first: A lot of us aren\’t even
remotely sexual during our periods. You may feel too uncomfortable, messy, or achy to be up for any kind of sexy activity.

<br><br>That said, if you are in the mood, your period\’s a great time for it. Why? Because an orgasm may help you deal with menstrual cramps. Here\’s how it works.
<br><br><b>Orgasm, Hormones, and Menstrual Cramps<br><br></b>
Your body produces a few hormones when you orgasm: serotonin, oxytocin, dopamine, and endorphins are the key players. You may have heard them referred to as "happiness hormones," and they\’re the ones that can make us feel better immediately.

<br><br>The relief orgasm can bring is twofold:
1. When you orgasm, your body releases the aforementioned happiness hormones, which act as natural and pretty strong pain relievers that help deal with menstrual cramps.

<br><br>While serotonin and oxytocin work together to help you get centered, calm, and collected, the dopamine and endorphins do their part by interacting with opioid receptors in your brain which makes your pain threshold higher.
2. At the same time, the increased blood flow to the uterus temporarily increases your pain tolerance even more.

<br><br>There are some additional orgasmic benefits thrown in for free: An orgasm can help reduce stress, improve sleep, generally make you more relaxed, and also it can feel really good.
<br><br><b>Keep It Safe<br><br></b>
As with anything in life, there are a couple of pretty important caveats to take into account before using sex as pain medicine.

<br><br>- First, there\’s evidence to suggest that the risk of contracting an STI may be higher during menstruation. Be sure to use a condom or dental dam if you\’re having penetrative or oral sex and properly clean any sex toys before and after use (a condom can also make this task way easier).

<br><br>- Second, if you\’re having sex that could lead to pregnancy, remember that the chances of pregnancy are small, but still real. So contraception may be a good idea if pregnancy is not in your plans!

<br><br>And of course, always remember that you
should never engage in any sexual activity if it feels painful, embarrassing, or uncomfortable.

    <string name="Cramps_Keeping_You_Up_Try_Switching_Up_Your_Sleeping_Position">Cramps Keeping You Up? Try Switching Up Your Sleeping Position</string>
    <string name="Cramps_Keeping_You_Up_Try_Switching_Up_Your_Sleeping_Position_content"><![CDATA[Many women report that although they feel
more tired during their period, they have a
harder time falling and staying asleep.

<br><br>Your sleep is regulated by a complex
interaction of hormones. As your hormones
fluctuate during your period, you may
experience insomnia due to decreased
progesterone in your body.

<br><br>In addition, falling asleep may be more of a
challenge, as pain in the abdomen can make the sleep positions you prefer uncomfortable.

<br><br>Studies also show that many women get less rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the days right before their period starts.

<br><br>REM sleep is essential for your body to repair itself and for your brain to process your day, which reduces stress.

<br><br>Getting less restorative REM sleep generally makes cramping and other PMS symptoms
more severe.

<br><br>Other studies link a reduced amount of
melatonin production to PMS, further affecting your quality of sleep.

<br><br>The good news is that there are some sleep
positions that may help you get more rest
during your period.
<br><br><b>Embryo position<br><br></b>
Lie on your side with your legs bent and draw your knees up to your chest. Bringing your knees closer to your chest may relieve cramps, as the "C" position reduces stretching and pressure on your uterus.

<br><br>It may also help prevent leaking through your pad or tampon.
<br><br><b>Baby position<br><br></b>
This position is similar to child\’s pose in yoga, and while it may sound a little unusual at first, it can help ease some of the strain on your abdominal muscles.

<br><br>Lie face down on the bed or a stack of pillows. Draw your knees toward your chest. Depending on your flexibility and comfort level, you may choose to widen the space between your knees to reduce pressure on your breasts.

<br><br>Some people enjoy widening their legs until the knees are on either side of their torso.
<br><br><b>On your back<br><br></b>
If you don\’t enjoy sleeping curled up, sleeping on your back may help reduce the strain on your abdomen and reduce cramps. Keeping your arms at your sides, instead of over your head, may prevent stretching that tightens already cramped parts of your pelvic floor.

<br><br>Important: Avoid sleeping on your stomach, as the stretching of your uterus and muscles surrounding it, as well as the added pressure, may increase the pain and soreness of cramps.
<br><br><b>Other suggestions for better sleep<br><br></b>
- Both lighter food and light exercise can help your body feel relaxed before bed. A smaller meal may help reduce the bloating that accompanies many women\’s periods, while the increased blood flow and endorphin release after a light workout can help ease the severity of cramps.

<br><br>- A warm bath or shower afterward may also help, since the warm water can help ease the tightness of your uterus and muscles.

<br><br>- It may also help to massage your abdomen gently while you\’re lying in bed.
<br><br><b>Summing up<br><br></b>
Getting plenty of sleep during your period can lead to less pain thanks to the positive impact it can have on your hormones and mood.

<br><br>The sleep positions we\’ve covered in this article may bring relief from the stretching and pressure of abdominal cramps, allowing for a more restful night. And better sleep during your period may help you feel refreshed the next day, so the relief may carry over into your waking life

<br><br>Plus, the more high quality sleep you get, the less overall stress you experience, and the easier it is to regulate your food cravings.

    <string name="Will_Relaxation_Help_If_Your_Belly_Hurts_content"><![CDATA[Cramping pains in the lower abdomen happen fairly often due to spasms in the uterus and intestines, which are caused by hormonal fluctuations.

<br><br>Breathing and muscle relaxation exercises can help relax your belly muscles, improve digestive functions, and relieve discomfort. Another way to relieve the pain is with a few yoga poses.

<br><br>Let\’s look at the most effective exercises.
<br><br><b>Breathing exercise<br><br></b>
Lie on your back and place a book (or another light object) on your belly. Slowly take a deep breath through your nose until your belly and the book rise.

<br><br>Hold the breath for a minute or less, tensing your belly muscles at the same time. Then
breathe out slowly.

<br><br>Repeat the exercise several times.
<br><br><b>Muscle relaxation<br><br></b>
Suck in your belly as much as you can, then
completely relax your muscles. Pump up your belly and tense your muscles as though you\’re bracing for an impact. Then, relax again.

<br><br>Repeat several times.
<br><br><b>Crocodile pose<br><br></b>
Lie on your belly. Bend your arms at the elbows and lay them down in front of you. Lower your face, resting your forehead on your forearms. Stretch your legs out and slightly separate them to either side.

<br><br>Remain in this pose for several minutes.
Breathe slowly and deeply, filling your belly with air.
<br><br><b>Child\’s pose<br><br></b>
Kneel down and sit on your heels. Lean forward and, after relaxing yourself, put your torso on your thighs. Put your hands on the floor, stretching them back along your body.

<br><br>Remain in this position for several minutes.

    <string name="Your_Diet_Can_Affect_Your_Cramps">Your Diet Can Affect Your Cramps</string>
    <string name="Your_Diet_Can_Affect_Your_Cramps_content"><![CDATA[During your period, the uterus produces large amounts of prostaglandins. These are
hormone-like substances that cause the uterus to contract and shed its lining (endometrium). The more prostaglandins, the stronger the contractions and more intense the pain they cause.

<br><br>To ease your cramps, try eating less foods that increase the production of prostaglandins. Some things to temporarily avoid include milk, sour cream, mayonnaise, butter, chicken, and turkey. These foods contain omega-6 unsaturated fatty acids, the precursor for prostaglandins

<br><br>Instead, you can eat foods that are rich in
omega-3 fatty acids, which will lower the
amount of prostaglandins produced. Salmon, soy, and walnuts are some examples of these foods.

<br><br>Vitamin E can also help. It suppresses
prostaglandin production and decreases their concentration in the bloodstream. You can get it from sunflower seeds and oil, hazelnuts, peanuts and peanut butter, spinach, and broccoli.

<br><br>Whole grain cereals (barley, quinoa, oatmeal, brown rice), pomegranates, pineapples, and tomatoes also slow down prostaglandin synthesis, which makes them great additions to your diet if you get cramps.

    <string name="Use_Light_Exercise_to_Stay_Pain_Free">Use Light Exercise to Stay Pain-Free</string>
    <string name="Use_Light_Exercise_to_Stay_Pain_Free_content"><![CDATA[In studies comparing women who engage in moderate exercise to women who have a
sedentary lifestyle, sedentary women reported more painful periods than women who exercised on a regular basis.

<br><br>Light to moderate exercise, defined as 150 minutes of elevated heart rate activity per
week, may help with your overall mood, reduce anxiety, and naturally boost serotonin levels. And light exercise alleviates the severity of menstrual cramps for many women.

<br><br>In fact, endorphins released during cardio
exercise are natural painkillers. The improved blood flow caused by exercise reduces the tension in your uterus and abdominal muscles, relaxing them and reducing cramping.
<br><br><b>Choosing the exercise that\’s right for you<br><br></b>
Light exercise takes many forms, and if you\’re just starting an exercise regimen, it\’s important to find an activity you like so you\’re more likely to stick to it.

<br><br>These are some good exercises to try during your period:

<br><br>- Moderate impact cardio, such as power
walking or light jogging, especially if you\’re able to get outdoors to walk or jog with a friend may be helpful. Some women may find the impact of walking or jogging too painful; riding a bicycle or using an elliptical trainer are also great options.

<br><br>- Certain kinds of stretching, such as gentle
yoga and chair yoga, may help ease the tight feeling in your core. The mindfulness of yoga may also help you reduce the stress that accompanies cramps.

<br><br>- Low-volume strength training, such as more reps with lighter weights or bodyweight routines, may also provide relief during your period. Lots of women find that heavy lifting during their period intensifies their cramps, so heavier weight-lifting sessions might be better for other phases of your cycle.

<br><br>There are also certain yoga asanas that can
help relieve menstrual pain and cramps.
<br><br><b>Activities to postpone<br><br></b>
Although most exercises are fine to practice during your period, some types of activity
should be avoided if you wish to reduce
menstrual cramps.

<br><br>Vigorous activity, such as distance running or endurance training on a bike or in the pool, may actually increase your tiredness more than usual. Likewise, skill and precision training may suffer.

<br><br>If you engage in these activities, you don\’t have to stop them entirely; instead, plan your training schedule to include lighter weeks during your periods.

    <string name="Medications_for_Period_Pain">Medications for Period Pain</string>
    <string name="Medications_for_Period_Pain_content"><![CDATA[There are several over-the-counter (OTC)
medications for treating dysmenorrhea that you can buy without a doctor\’s prescription.

<br><br><b>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs </b>
(NSAIDs) can be effective in treating
dysmenorrhea (period cramps) because they help reduce inflammation, which in turn often relieves pain.

<br><br>They work by blocking prostaglandins, which make your nerve endings sensitive to
inflammation, thereby decreasing the intensity of uterine contractions.

<br><br>Here is a list of <b>NSAIDs that are specifically approved</b> by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for treatment of
dysmenorrhea:

<br><br>- Diclofenac

<br><br>- Ibuprofen (OTC)

<br><br>- Ketoprofen

<br><br>- Meclofenamate

<br><br>- Mefenamic acid

<br><br>- Naproxen (OTC)

<br><br>You may get more relief by taking these
remedies at the beginning of your menstrual cycle and continuing to take them until your
symptoms go away.

<br><br>Remember, NSAIDs are only meant for short-term use, and other risks may arise with continued, long-term use. Common side effects of these medications include diarrhea, gas, and stomach upset. They may also cause lightheadedness, dizziness or mild headache. Your risk of side effects increases the longer you use them.

<br><br>Be sure to use any medication as directed and learn the potential risks of every medicine you take.

<br><br>Important: many medicines contain NSAIDs, including some used for colds, flu, and sleep, so make sure to avoid taking multiple
medicines that contain NSAIDs.

<br><br>Talk to your health care professional or
pharmacist if you have questions or concerns about NSAIDs or which medicines contain them.

    <string name="Why_Your_Breasts_Are_Sore_and_What_You_Can_Do_content"><![CDATA[OK, it\’s not exactly the funnest club to be in,
but on the plus side, it does have a lot of
members - 70 percent of women experience breast pain of some kind at some point. On top of that, up to two-thirds deal with it on the regular as part of their menstrual cycle. Yes, when it comes to mastalgia (AKA breast pain) most of us are full-fledged, achy members of the Sore Boobs Club.

<br><br>So if you\’re one of us, what do you need to
know about the different types of breast pain? Let\’s dive into cyclical and non-cyclical pain; how you can alleviate your symptoms and when it\’s time for medical treatment - basically all the info you need to figure out what\’s bothering your boobs so you can get back to, uh… being your breast self.
<br><br><b>What is cyclic breast pain? <br><br></b>
As you might have already gathered, cyclic
breast pain is linked to your menstrual cycle. During the luteal phase (that\’s the second two weeks of your cycle, your hormone levels shift around. But since we\’re talking about breast pain, let\’s focus on two of them progesterone, a sex hormone, and prolactin, a hormone responsible for lactation and breast development. These shifts can trigger changes in the milk ducts or milk glands that can cause breast pain (and sometimes even painful breast cysts).

<br><br>However, just like pretty much every aspect of our cycle, how breast pain manifests varies from one person to the next, and while some experience mild to moderate pain for 2-3 days pre-period, others can have severe pain that lasts a week or more.
<br><br><b>Is it linked to your cycle? <br><br></b>
Breast pain isn\’t the most straightforward
symptom - there are both cyclical and non-
cyclical types - so we\’ve compiled this handy Cyclic Breast Pain Checklist for you to spot the key signs:

<br><br>- Starts up to two weeks before your period
and gets better after your period

<br><br>- Usually affects both breasts, particularly the upper, outer portions, but you might also find that one breast hurts more than the other

<br><br>- Can spread to your underarms

<br><br>- Breasts feel heavy, achy, swollen, lumpy, or
sensitive

<br><br>To really get to the bottom of it, try keeping a breast pain diary. You can use the Notes and quickly spot any patterns. Plus, having this info can come in handy when you\’re asked about your medical history at appointments.
<br><br><b>What can you do about it? <br><br></b>
With breast pain, like so many aspects of our cycle, it\’s complicated. In addition to hormones, other factors can trigger breast pain, like medication or the wrong bra (at the same time, these can also exacerbate cyclic breast pain hey, we said it was complicated. Thankfully, there are lots of ways to tackle it, so let\’s get into it!
<br><br><b>Check your bra<br><br></b>
We\’ve been wearing bras - or something like
them- for thousands of years, but that doesn\’t mean we\’re getting it right - 80 % of
women wear bras that aren\’t the right size. If it\’s too small, it can dig into your breasts, and if it\’s too big, your boobs can bounce around, exacerbating pain.

<br><br>Wearing a bra that fits is super important, but finding one can be a challenge - sizing varies among brands, and you need to be measured often enough to account for changes in your shape or size. The easiest way to deal with this is getting a professional bra fitting. But if that\’s not an option you can do it yourself too. And if
you\’ve noticed your boobs are much bigger
before your period, you might want to get fitted then too, to see if you need to go up a cup size. When your breasts are sore, it can also help to wear a bra that offers more support (especially when exercising).
<br><br><b>Take pain relief<br><br></b>
After consulting with a doctor, you may
consider taking acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen, which have both been shown to be useful.
<br><br><b>Sleep smart<br><br></b>
You may find sleeping on your back helps. If you\’re an avowed side sleeper, prop a pillow
underneath your boobs for extra cushioning
and support.
<br><br><b>Monitor medication<br><br></b>
Some medications, including contraceptive
pills, antidepressants, blood pressure medicines, and antibiotics can cause breast pain and worsen your cyclic symptoms. This is another thing you can track to determine if you need to schedule an appointment to talk about it.
<br><br><b>Tweak your eats<br><br></b>
Some people find limiting or even eliminating caffeine or salty foods lessens symptoms. A diet that\’s low in fat and high in complex carbohydrates might also help. Taking vitamin E or evening primrose oil may also help, but there isn\’t any scientific evidence that these are effective.
<br><br><b>What if it\’s something else?

<br><br>How to check your breasts: <br><br></b>
It\’s important to know how your breasts usually look and feel so you can spot any changes. Try to spend a couple of minutes once a month checking them - doctors often recommend self-examining the week after your period ends when your breasts may be less tender. Look at and feel each breast and armpit, all the way up to your collarbone (you may find this easier to do soaped up in the shower or bath). Also look at your breasts in the mirror with your arms by
your side and raised. It\’s time to seek medical attention if you notice:

<br><br>- Change in the size, outline, or shape of your breast

<br><br>- Change to the skin (e.g., puckering, dimpling, rash, or redness)

<br><br>- Swelling or thickening or a new lump or
bumpy area in one breast or armpit

<br><br>- Any change in nipple position (e.g., turning
inward)

<br><br>- Fluid or bloody discharge from either nipple
- Rash, crusting, scaly or itchy skin, or redness on/around your nipple

<br><br>- Any pain in one breast, particularly if it\’s new and doesn\’t go away

<br><br>Noncyclic breast pain is not related to your
menstrual cycle, so it can occur at any time. It usually affects one breast in a specific area; can be constant or intermittent; is described as tight, burning, stabbing or aching; and its causes include injury, infection, medication and in some cases, pregnancy.

<br><br>Generally, noncyclic breast pain signals a
noncancerous (benign) breast condition, but in rare cases, it can be caused by breast cancer. If it continues for more than a couple of weeks, worsens over time, interferes with daily activities, wakes you at night, or you feel a lump - or you\’re simply worried about it - seek medical attention right away.
<br><br><b>Final rule of Sore Boobs Club<br><br></b>
So that\’s breast pain, pretty much - not fun
and unfortunately common, but hopefully
manageable with some helpful strategies and support from your health care provider. If you can, schedule a fitting, and see you same time, same place next month.

    <string name="Tips_for_Tackling_Period_Headaches_and_Migraines">Tips for Tackling Period Headaches and Migraines</string>
    <string name="Tips_for_Tackling_Period_Headaches_and_Migraines_content"><![CDATA[Ever get that constant, throbbing head pain
around the time of your period? How about a full-on migraine that has you retreating to your bed for the day? Either way, period headaches are officially THE WORST. (OK, and cramps, but they already get a lot of airtime.) So what does the research say?

<br><br>Well, multiple studies have found that more
than half of cisgender women who get migraines have noticed an association between their headaches and their period. A study in the Journal of Neurology also found that your chances of getting a migraine are highest on those first days of your period, and lowest around ovulation. There\’s no doubt period headaches are thing, so now let\’s take a closer look at the hormones at play and how you can manage them.
<br><br><b>What are period-related headaches and why do you get them? <br><br></b>
Period-related headaches are those thought to be connected with your menstrual cycle. The most common type being tension-type
headaches and migraines, described as a
feeling of tightening on both sides of the head. Getting headaches around the time of your period is thought to be linked to estrogen, which rises in the first half of your cycle. You might notice it actually boosts your mood and makes you feel more confident in the lead up to ovulation - check you out! Annoyingly though it then plummets right before your period. In other words, saying goodbye to estrogen means saying a reluctant hello to painful headaches or migraines for some of us.

<br><br>Another factor at play could be prostaglandins - natural chemicals made in the lining of your uterus that ramp up during your period to help you shed your uterine lining. (You might be more familiar with something else they\’re responsible for: painful period cramps.) Research reveals that there may be more prostaglandins in patients with migraines. The Migraine Trust also found that women who struggle with heavy and painful periods tend to have higher levels of prostaglandins; meaning
they could also be more prone to getting
migraines or headaches. Interesting, but not
exactly fun ... like, at all.

<br><br>Of course, there are plenty of other reasons for headaches, from neglecting that oversized water bottle you bought a few years back to stressing over a tight deadline. If you\’re unsure what\’s causing yours, try using the Flo app to log your symptoms to spot potential triggers. If you find they get worse around your period and
better during ovulation, or they appear
alongside other common, period-related
symptoms like bloating and cramps, it\’s likely your cycle is to blame.
<br><br><b>What\’s the difference between tension-type headaches and migraines? <br><br></b>
Once you\’ve established your headaches are cycle-related, you might be wondering about the differences between a tension-type headache and a migraine. Tension-type headaches are usually characterized by more of a constant ache, felt mainly in the head, but sometimes behind the eyes and in the neck muscles. They can last anywhere from half an hour to a few days, but are usually mild enough not to interfere with daily activities.

<br><br>Migraines, on the other hand, are usually much more intense. They\’re often felt on just one side of the head and can also affect the face and neck. Migraine pain is more of a throbbing feeling and can be severe enough to stop you from going about your daily activities.
<br><br><b>So, how can you tackle period-related
headaches? <br><br></b>
Now that you\’re in the know of what\’s behind the inconveniences that are period headaches, what can you do to prevent and ease them?
Thankfully, quite a lot ...

<br><br><b>Drink more water: </b> It might sound simple, but a little dehydration can easily trigger a headache, so get that H20 in whenever you can!

<br><br><b>Get enough sleep: </b> According to The Sleep
Foundation, you\’re more likely to struggle with sleep if you experience migraines and we also know that having PMS makes you more likely to experience insomnia.

<br><br><b>Cut back on screen time: </b> You\’ve heard it
before, but it\’s true: Being glued to your screen all day is not good for a whole host of reasons, headaches among them. Research published by the International Headache Society found that those who spent over two hours a day on screens were more likely to report migraines. In other words, that video of fainting goats can wait.

<br><br><b>Keep snacking: </b> If you\’re nauseous as hell
during your period, food is often the last thing on your mind. But snacking frequently and not skipping meals is really important for keeping your blood sugar steady. Go too long without food, and your body will release hormones to remind your brain to eat. That would be super handy if it didn\’t cause your blood vessels to constrict and give you a massive headache!

<br><br><b>Essential oils: </b> You might know that lavender can help you drift off to sleep, but did you know it could also help with your migraines too? A study published in The European Journal of Neurology found that 47% of those with migraines noticed a lot less pain just fifteen minutes after inhaling lavender oil. Another study found that peppermint oil could also be helpful.

<br><br><b>Medication: </b> There are a few medications that can help with headaches and migraines. Just make sure to talk with your healthcare provider first, especially if you get them regularly. They might prescribe you triptans (which are essentially pain-blockers) or anti-inflammatories to take before you get a headache so you can tackle it before it begins. Birth control pills might also help, but it\’s worth noting that some people get headaches during their pill-free period. People who get certain types of migraine are also advised not to use the combined contraceptive pill, so make sure
to mention that you get migraines at your
appointment.
<br><br><b>What should you do if your headaches are
seriously painful or won\’t go away? <br><br></b>
Not all headaches are period-related, so if
you\’re struggling with severe pain or with a
headache or migraine that just won\’t end, you need to talk to your health care provider as soon as possible. A sudden onset or increased frequency of headaches, headaches after any head trauma, or any neurological symptoms all warrant scheduling an appointment ASAP.

    <string name="Always_Tired_It_Could_Be_Period_Fatigue">Always Tired? It Could Be Period Fatigue</string>
    <string name="Always_Tired_It_Could_Be_Period_Fatigue_content"><![CDATA[Life can get crazy sometimes. Between early morning alarms, long working days, and endless social commitments, most of us are more than ready to crash come bedtime. But what happens when your cycle turns a little tiredness into full-on fatigue? We\’re talking a feeling of exhaustion not even sleeping in on a Sunday can shake. What\’s more, it can come with a range of other symptoms like mood changes, dizziness, brain fog, and taking longer to make decisions - fun, huh?

<br><br>Luckily, cycle-related fatigue isn\’t usually
serious. You should see your health care
provider if it persists, but simply tracking how you feel might reveal a pattern that helps you take control and tackle it!
<br><br><b>So what makes it cycle-related fatigue? <br><br></b>
Cycle-related fatigue is a feeling of exhaustion (mental or physical) that seems to get worse at specific points in your cycle. The most common time? You guessed it - it\’s that lovely week leading up to your period. And it\’s really common. A study published in BMC Women\’s Health found that nearly a whopping 90% of those with Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) struggled with fatigue and around 94% of those with PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder). That\’s not to say fatigue can\’t occur at other points in your cycle too though; fluctuating hormones could be the culprit, or lower iron levels than usual after your period.
<br><br><b>What causes it? <br><br></b>
Firstly, hormonal changes - We now know
fatigue seems to be part of PMS and PMDD, so the most likely explanation is that when
estrogen and progesterone plummet the week before your period, they cause tiredness.

<br><br>But there are also some reasons it can pop up at other points in your cycle too. Heavy periods can lead to low iron levels, which may make you feel fatigued. Of course another, slightly more obvious, reason could be lack of sleep. According to The Sleep Foundation, a source for evidence-based sleep health information,
women with PMS are twice as likely to
experience insomnia before their period. Add tossing and turning with period pain into the mix, and your sleep could be seriously out of whack. Not pleasant.
<br><br><b>What can you do about it? <br><br></b>
If you think your fatigue is related to heavy or painful periods, the first step is to see a health care provider. Once you\’ve ruled out anemia (low levels of iron from blood loss during your period) and any more serious reasons out, there are some simple lifestyle changes that could help. Let\’s start with the obvious two: diet and exercise. While it may be the last thing you feel like doing, one study in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that exercise improved PMS, along with associated
symptoms such as fatigue and confusion.
Worth a try in our books! There\’s also yoga,
which is not only proven to help PMS symptoms, but chronic fatigue syndrome too definitely worth adding to your toolbox.

<br><br>If your doctor does diagnose you with lower
iron levels, you might find your fatigue improves by eating more iron-rich foods like spinach, legumes, and red meat. You could also focus on a diet rich in complex carbohydrates - a study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that eating more whole grains helps with PMS symptoms.

<br><br>Something else you might want to dodge?
Sugary foods. We know it can be extra hard if you experience PMS-fuelled sugar cravings, but blood sugar spikes and crashes are a perfect recipe for fatigue. Instead, opt for whole grains, such as whole wheat and brown rice - they keep blood sugar steadier, which could help you avoid those energy dips.

<br><br>If you\’re more into your herbal remedies and supplements, there\’s not a whole lot of
evidence out there, but you might find this
interesting: According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, calcium supplements can help with both the physical and mental symptoms of PMS. Be sure to check with your health care provider before you start taking any supplements so they can advise you on proper dosage and make sure it\’s safe for you to take.
<br><br><b>How can I tell the difference between
regular fatigue and fatigue related to my
cycle? <br><br></b>
Sometimes the cause of fatigue is obvious:
We\’re just not getting enough sleep. Whether you\’re working long hours or the baby\’s keeping you up all night, some fatigue is normal if you\’re busy, so start by tracking how much sleep you\’re actually getting - you might be surprised to find you\’re nowhere near that 8-hour goal!

<br><br>The next step is to track your cycle so you
notice if fatigue is worse at certain times each cycle. The week leading up to your period is a good one to pay close attention to. If you find the feeling subsides after these patches, it\’s more likely to be cycle-related fatigue.

<br><br>So, you\’ve been diligently tracking any
patterns, made a few changes to your routine, and you\’re still feeling totally pooped? Now it\’s time to look at some other possible causes:

<br><br>- Low iron (especially if your periods are heavy)

<br><br>- Lack of vitamin D

<br><br>- Medication side effects

<br><br>- Stress

<br><br>- Depression

<br><br>- Too much caffeine

<br><br>... and the list goes on.

<br><br>Whatever the cause though, cycle-related
fatigue usually isn\’t severe and doesn\’t
interfere with your daily life. If you\’ve been
feeling constantly tired for more than four
weeks, it\’s a good idea to see your healthcare provider so they can determine whether a medical condition could be causing your tiredness.

<br><br>In short, fatigue can range from reeeeally
annoying to a major pain, but it\’s usually not a sign of something serious. Even better
simply tracking it for a while could be all it takes to pinpoint the cause and take action. In other words, hopefully you\’ll be getting those extra Z\’s in no time. May good sleep be with you.

    <string name="Backache_The_Less_Talked_About_Period_Pain">Backache: The Less Talked About Period Pain</string>
    <string name="Backache_The_Less_Talked_About_Period_Pain_content"><![CDATA[Cramps. What a pain in the …. back? Yup,
they\’re not just for your tummy. While we know dysmenorrhea (the fancy term for period cramps) is very common, many of us experience backache too. A study in the
Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care found around 16% of those surveyed
experienced period pain in the lower back
while 24% experienced it in the back, thighs,
and lower abdomen. While it\’s not uncommon, you\’d still rather it didn\’t happen to you at all, right? So let\’s equip you with the tools you need to get on top of it.
<br><br><b>How is backache related to your period? <br><br></b>
Your backache is likely cycle-related if it seems to occur right before or during your period. Sure, abdominal period pain (AKA period cramps) is more common around this time, but feeling it in the lower back or even the thigh area is totally normal too. Backache can be experienced on its own or in addition to lower abdominal pain - thank you, Mother Nature! The silver lining, though, is that when it comes to cyclical backache, it tends to disappear once your period ends. Phew.
<br><br><b>Why does it happen? <br><br></b>
Your period isn\’t the most comfortable time as it is, so you\’re probably wondering why
backache is another thing you have to contend with. We totally feel you. But if it makes you feel a bit better, there is actually a logical, scientific reason behind it all: the muscles in your uterus contracting. Now, this happens all the time (yours may even be doing it right now!) but for most of your cycle, these contractions won\’t be strong enough to actually notice. When your period kicks into action, however, these contractions intensify to help the uterus shed its lining so you start bleeding.

<br><br>It\’s at this time that your body releases pain-triggering chemicals (which do exactly what it sounds like: cause pain!) called prostaglandins, which make these contractions feel way more intense. The nerves in this area can then send that pain to your back or down your thighs. So, while period cramps, like backache, are no fun,
they\’re actually a sign that your body is doing its job. Go body!
<br><br><b>Why doesn\’t everyone get period backaches? <br><br></b>
The answer to this one\’s a little trickier. We
don\’t know exactly why some people
experience back pain during their periods when others don\’t, but one theory is that it could be connected to having a heavier flow. A study in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care found that women who had long periods and heavy periods with clots were more likely to experience period cramps. It may also be that some of us are more sensitive to hormonal changes, since back pain is also a symptom of the more severe PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder). Research in the Journal of
Women\’s Health found that inflammation could also play a part - those who have it are more likely to experience back pain.
<br><br><b>How do you know if your backache is period-related? <br><br></b>
There are a few ways to tell cycle-related
backache from the regular kind. The most
obvious one is that the pain is cyclical, so it
should ease off once your period ends. (You can use the Flo app to track any patterns,
making it easier to identify when your period is the cause.) If you still find yourself flinching post-period though, it\’s time to chat with your health care provider about what else could be causing it.

<br><br>It\’s also important to note that if you experience severe back pain during your period, it could also be a sign of other gynecological conditions that get worse during menstruation, like endometriosis. So if you have backaches during your period that leave you sofa-bound schedule an appointment to get checked out.
<br><br><b>What can you do to ease cyclical backache? <br><br></b>
Even though it\’s the last thing you might feel like doing, many find exercise to be their miracle cure for cramps. Head here for a bunch of great workouts to try during your cycle. If you feel like rest is a better option for you, that works too. You could always swap your spin class for some at-home stretching or a simple yoga routine if you\’d like to keep moving. If you want to take a more targeted approach, heat pads are definitely worth a go too. (A massage is also an option - treat yourself!)

<br><br>If all else fails, we also know that period pain responds well to anti-inflammatories, so ask your health care provider about whether taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen might help. Finally, you could also ask about the contraceptive pill, patch, or a hormonal IUD
they keep the uterine lining thin, which leads to fewer contractions and less painful periods.

<br><br>Time for some parting thoughts. If you find your backache is cyclical and disappears after a few days, take it as the perfect excuse to watch your fave box set from bed. If it hangs around for longer and you notice it affecting your life, make sure to chat to your health care provider so you can get back to being you.

outburst at our other half\’s poor attempt at the dishwasher or ugly crying over a friend\’s
innocent remark. Or sometimes, there doesn\’t even need to be a trigger at all.

<br><br>Yep, we\’re talking about mood swings - that
completely normal, but not always welcome, part of our menstrual cycles. They\’re one of the most common features of premenstrual
syndrome (PMS) - the physical and emotional symptoms that pop up before your period. Feeling depressed, irritable, bad-tempered, upset, anxious, and emotional are just some of the moods you might experience.
<br><br><b>So is my mood PMS? <br><br></b>
Here are a few easy ways to tell your mood
swings are probably linked to your cycle:

<br><br>- It\’s the same kind of emotional rollercoaster each month - PMS symptoms tend to follow a pattern over time, and they can affect your normal life.

<br><br>- Mood swings begin within the two-week window before your period starts. This is the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle (post-ovulation, but pre-period).

<br><br>- Mood swings last from a few days to two
weeks and peak about two days before your period starts.

<br><br>- They ease up once your period starts or
before it\’s over.

<br><br>- Anger and irritability are the biggest
offenders and might start slightly earlier than other symptoms.

<br><br>- You\’re getting other PMS-related symptoms, such as tiredness or trouble sleeping, headaches, changes in appetite, food cravings, feeling clumsy, bloating, sore or tender breasts, skin problems, and stomach pain.

<br><br>- We don\’t know exactly why PMS occurs, but it might be due to changing hormone levels during your cycle, and some people are more sensitive to these changes than others.
<br><br><b>Managing mood swings<br><br></b>
The good news is there are steps you can take to help you deal with these ups and downs.

<br><br><b>Diet: </b> There\’s evidence that certain vitamins
and minerals may be mood boosters. Vitamin B6 supplements might help relieve PMS-related depression, irritability, and tiredness. Chicken, turkey, oats, bananas, and milk are all good sources. Calcium can also benefit your mood, and you can find it in dairy products like milk and cheese, as well as leafy green vegetables, soy drinks with added calcium, and fish with edible bones, like sardines. Magnesium may also help with mood swings and constipation
before a period. Find it in nuts, spinach, and
whole-grain bread.

<br><br><b>Exercise: </b> Don\’t skip the gym when you\’re
feeling low because regular aerobic exercise may lessen feelings of depression during your PMS window. Other options you could try are brisk walking, jogging, running, swimming, or dancing.

<br><br><b>Relaxation techniques: </b> Carving out time to
relax could benefit your mood. Yoga, breathing exercises, and meditation may all help.

<br><br><b>Sleep: </b> Try to get enough z\’s and keep a regular sleep routine by going to bed and getting up at around the same time every day - even on weekends.

<br><br><b>Non-hormonal medication: </b> Two types of
antidepressants - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)
have been found to alleviate mood-related PMS symptoms.

<br><br><b>Hormonal options: </b> For some people, using
combined oral contraceptive pills or estrogen hormone patches or gels help ease the psychological symptoms of PMS.
<br><br><b>When is it more serious? <br><br></b>
A small number of people get a more severe form of PMS called premenstrual dysphoric
disorder (PMDD). The symptoms feel more
intense and can have a major impact on daily activities, relationships, and quality of life. Emotional symptoms can include feeling very anxious, angry, depressed, or, in some cases, suicidal.

<br><br>If you\’re experiencing any of these symptoms, ask for an urgent appointment with your health care provider for advice. If you feel you may be about to harm yourself, contact emergency services.
<br><br><b>Log it, own it<br><br></b>
To help you identify whether your mood swings are due to PMS, log your symptoms in the app over two menstrual cycles before seeing a health care professional - it could help them make a diagnosis. You can select a range of emotions, including irritation, sadness, guilt, and feeling self-critical. Plus, you can also record other PMS symptoms, such as breast tenderness, fatigue, insomnia, food cravings, bloating, and headaches.

<br><br>If you try different methods to manage your
PMS moods, make sure to log them so you can start to see what works! There isn\’t a cure for PMS, but you can make mood swings more manageable. But no guarantees your friend won\’t get on your nerves every now and then.

    <string name="_7_Causes_of_Mood_Swings_That_Aren_t_PMS_content"><![CDATA[Many of us experience emotional ups and
downs sometimes as part of premenstrual
syndrome (PMS). You probably know the drill when it comes to those familiar physical and emotional symptoms that kick in as early as two weeks before your period.

<br><br>Our emotions at this time can be a real roller-coaster, from anger and irritability to feeling upset and teary to full-on guilt and anxiety. This is all pretty normal. But there are also other conditions that can mimic, or even overlap, with PMS. It\’s worth figuring out if something else is going on as it could be something that could get a lot better with some medical attention. So let\’s take a look at some of the main causes.
So what else could it be?
#1: Depression or anxiety: Depression and
anxiety are the most common conditions that overlap with PMS. Around 50 percent of women looking for treatment for PMS also have one of these disorders. The symptoms of all three are pretty similar, but with depression, symptoms can last all month and get worse before or during periods.

<br><br>#2: Endometriosis: This is a disorder where
tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other places, such as the uterine tubes and ovaries. Because endometriosis is a long-term condition and can cause chronic pain, it can lead to feelings of depression.

<br><br>#3: Underactive thyroid: Also known as
hypothyroidism, an underactive thyroid gland doesn\’t produce enough hormones. Along with tiredness and weight gain, the most common sign of an underactive thyroid is feeling depressed.

<br><br>#4: Overactive thyroid: With hyperthyroidism, the opposite is happening
- the thyroid gland produces too many thyroid hormones. Mood swings, nervousness, anxiety, and irritability are
all common for people with an overactive
thyroid.

<br><br>#5: Perimenopause: When the ovaries stop
consistently producing as much estrogen and no longer release an egg each month, periods eventually stop, and menopause begins. But symptoms can start a few months or even years before periods stop. This hormonal roller-coaster can go on for many years. Mood swings are a common feature of perimenopause.

<br><br>#6: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS):
Signs of this condition include irregular periods, excess facial and body hair caused by high levels of "male" hormones, and many fluid-filled sacs surrounding the eggs in the ovaries. The ovaries do not release eggs regularly and hormonal levels are out of balance. Because people with POS may be overweight, and suffer from acne and abnormal hair growth which can have a major effect on confidence and self-esteem, people who have it are at higher risk of developing depression and mood swings.

<br><br>#7: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
(PMDD): A small number of people get a more severe form of PMS called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Signs of PMDD include feeling very anxious, angry, depressed, or, in some cases, suicidal in the two weeks before a period. People with PMDD have a very hard time functioning during this time. If you feel you may be about to harm yourself, contact
emergency services.
<br><br><b>Endometriosis in focus<br><br></b>
Around one in 10 women of reproductive age are diagnosed with endometriosis. These are the most common signs to watch out for:

<br><br>- Long-term pelvic pain, especially before or
during your period

<br><br>- Pain during sex

<br><br>- Pain when you go to the bathroom

<br><br>- Heavy periods

<br><br>If you\’re experiencing any of these symptoms alongside feelings of depression, see your health care provider.
<br><br><b>When is it PMS? <br><br></b>
OK, so we\’ve looked at other potential causes of mood swings, but how can you tell for sure if your feelings are just a healthy and normal part of your menstrual cycle? It\’s likely to be PMS if you\’re experiencing the same kind of mood pattern month after month and if your mood swings appear - along with other PMS symptoms like breast and nipple tenderness - around two weeks before your period. They should ease up once your period begins. To find out more, read our article about mood swings and your cycle.

    <string name="Birth_Control_and_Mood_Swings_Cause_or_Cure">Birth Control and Mood Swings: Cause or Cure?</string>
    <string name="Birth_Control_and_Mood_Swings_Cause_or_Cure_content"><![CDATA[If you\’re feeling low, angry, anxious, or irritable, it can be hard to pinpoint why (see our articles on Mood Swings and Your Cycle and 8 Causes of Mood Swings That Aren\’t PMS). And when you\’re using a hormonal birth control method, the picture becomes even murkier. We put these questions to Dr.
Barbara Levy, clinical professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences.

<br><br>Is your birth control helping or hindering your emotional turbulence? Would you be better off without it?
<br><br><b>How hormonal contraceptives influence
mood<br><br></b>
"When we talk about the potential for
contraceptives to impact our moods, we\’re
really talking about the hormones in
contraceptives because our moods are
absolutely impacted by hormones," says
Dr.Levy.

<br><br>The female sex hormones estrogen and
progesterone influence our brain chemistry and neurotransmitter (the body\’s chemical
messengers) levels, and hormonal
contraceptives work by using synthetic
versions of these hormones.

<br><br>"Estrogen-based contraceptives, for example, will give you higher levels of one of the neurotransmitters that influence depression: serotonin. That\’s why treatment for depression often involves increasing levels of serotonin. Progesterone is another hormone that can lead to emotional sensitivity. There are a number of synthetic variations of progesterone in contraceptives each of which can lead to different effects, depression being one of them" says Dr.Levy.
<br><br><b>When they can help<br><br></b>
Dr. Levy stresses that it\’s not the progesterone levels that can lead to mood swings and feelings of depression, but rather that some people are more susceptible than others to progesterone in their system. The synthetic versions are quite different in their makeup some can lead to moodiness and depression while others can improve symptoms.

<br><br>"Some women, whose cycles are not
suppressed by hormonal birth control, get
mood disorders just before their period
because natural progesterone levels peak
during the second half of the cycle, around two weeks before your period. For them, using a hormonal contraceptive can smooth everything out and prevent that peak and dip in progesterone. Instead of having these cycles that go from feeling great to feeling terrible right before their period, the benefit of hormonal contraception is that its hormonal levels - and therefore hormone-dependent moods - are even throughout the cycle," she says.
<br><br><b>What to look out for<br><br></b>
However, Dr. Levy mentions a few things to be mindful of.

<br><br>"It\’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. Sometimes progesterone levels are even, and you can feel really good. Sometimes those levels are even, and you can feel bad. It depends on how an individual responds to the particular hormones in their contraception.

<br><br>As a clinician, I will look at the patient\’s history and figure out in advance of prescribing them contraception. What\’s the real issue here? Does this person have underlying depression that gets worse before their period, or are they perfectly \’normal\’ until just before their cycle, and then they have problems? Those are two
different things and should be treated
differently in terms of the balance of estrogen and progesterone in
a contraceptive," says Dr.Levy.
<br><br><b>When to seek help<br><br></b>
If you\’re taking a new hormonal contraceptive, it\’s a good idea to keep track of your moods in the app to see whether your contraception might be impacting how you feel. But Dr. Levy cautions that you should take immediate action if your mood is very low and affecting your life.

<br><br>"If your mood suddenly changes and you begin to feel depressed when taking
a hormonal contraceptive, contact your health care provider to talk about switching because there could be a better formulation out there." she says. "Contraceptives have variable levels and formulations (synthetic types) of estrogen and progesterone, so it\’s about finding a balance to hopefully get an ideal formulation for you."

<br><br>Be sure to use some other method of
contraception if you want to prevent pregnancy and you decide to stop your hormonal birth control.

<br><br>If you think you may be experiencing more
severe symptoms, make an urgent appointment with your health care provider. If you think you might harm yourself, contact emergency services.

    <string name="Real_People_Share_How_To_Beat_The_Blues_content"><![CDATA[When it comes to combating mood swings,
there\’s power in numbers. We took to our
Secret Chats in the Flo app to dig out all the
surprising tips and tricks you\’re all sharing to keep those emotions in check. Here\’s what we found.
<br><br><b>Tip #1: Ditch the junk food<br><br></b>
Sweets and ice cream are our friends right?
Sadly, not always. What might seem like a
delicious dose of sugar-coated calm can in fact be the very thing triggering your anxiety and low mood. Bummer, right?

<br><br>Don\’t worry, it\’s not all bad. Some of you have already discovered that healthier alternatives can help you stay more balanced and in control. One user swears by "cartoons and dark chocolate" (much more nutritious than milk chocolate), while another opts for "ginger tea after some gentle stretching!"

<br><br>Makes sense: after all, studies have shown
eating fruit and vegetables reduces your
chance of becoming depressed later in life.
<br><br><b>Tip #2: Blast those tunes<br><br></b>
Singing at the top of your lungs with the car
windows rolled down … busting some moves in your bedroom mirror … listening to your favorite dance floor classics - in its many different forms, music seems to be the biggest serotonin-booster for many of you throughout those emotionally charged pre-period days.

<br><br>Studies have long shown the healing powers of a good bass line on our mental health, and soothing depression and anxiety is high on the list of benefits it can bring. Just try to keep it upbeat - users suggest anything from "calming music" to "rock and roll." In short, it\’s probably not the right time for Adele.
<br><br><b>Tip #3: Fall in love with you<br><br></b>
Positive affirmations (for example, I am
amazing. I am strong.), at-home pampering,
watching movies, masturbating … let\’s just call it all self-love. It means something different to everyone, but it\’s what many users turn to when they\’re feeling down during their cycle. One user recommends "a relaxing bath, hot shower, and a nice cuppa;" another says, "journaling has become the best friend that reminds them the bad times will pass.

<br><br>But it\’s not just about having an excuse to treat yourself. Studies show that self-esteem is actually proven to have a positive effect on your mood. So, the kinder you are to yourself, the better you\’ll feel. Time to work on it!
<br><br><b>Tip #4: Get out of your head<br><br></b>
Mindfulness is known to be a great tool when it comes to our mental well-being. Studies show it\’s linked to increased feelings of comfort and relaxation, as well as reduced feelings of anxiety and depression. It\’ll come as no surprise then that this goes for your monthly mood swings, too - a win-win!

<br><br>One user started meditating last spring and
says, "I\’m way less stressed, don\’t overthink as much, and can\’t even remember my last mood swing!" Another user claims it stopped her negative thinking, saying,
"I was always miserable and on edge, but now I feel a lot more chilled out." If you struggle to get into the zone when it comes to meditation, don\’t give up on the idea yet - another user says, "deep-breathing works just as well too." Namaste.
<br><br><b>Tip #5: Move your body<br><br></b>
It\’s normally the last thing in the world we want to do when we\’re feeling down, but many of you say exercise is the key to staying sane when your hormones are running haywire. For some, it\’s all about gentle stretching and leisurely strolls. Others say the more intense the workout, the better.

<br><br>Thankfully, research says it\’s less about what you do, and more about how often you do it, so don\’t worry if a brisk walk around the block is all you can manage. Essentially, no matter how good staying glued to your couch might feel, moving will make you feel 10 times better. Promise.

    <string name="How_Exercise_Helped_Me_Beat_Mood_Swings">How Exercise Helped Me Beat Mood Swings</string>
    <string name="How_Exercise_Helped_Me_Beat_Mood_Swings_content"><![CDATA[Mood swings out of control? You\’re not alone my friend, believe me. I\’m Katie, a Content Editor here, and once upon a time, managing my moods was easy-breezy. I mean sure there was the odd tear and occasional outburst here and there, but for the most part, I could handle it. Little did I know ... that was all about to change.

<br><br>I can\’t pinpoint exactly when things started to go downhill, all I know is it was normal for my day to be totally ruined by a sad TV
commercial, a poorly phrased text, or even
something as simple as forgetting to buy
bananas. Sound like you too? Don\’t worry!
Because I\’ve come out the other side. Heck, I can even look back and laugh now. Kinda. And that\’s all down to one thing: EXERCISE. It might just help you too..
<br><br><b>Morning yoga<br><br></b>
The first time I set my alarm half an hour early to do some yoga, it was tough, I\’m not gonna lie. But as soon as I realized how awesome it made me feel, I never looked back, and you won\’t either! Research tells us it takes around two months to form a new habit, but I found it took me just two weeks for yoga to become a practice I just can\’t be without. More levelled out emotions, feelings of gratitude that keep my mood lifted, better perspective, and moments of calm and clear-headedness are just a few of the ways yoga has improved my day-to-day. Now I\’m even one of those cheesy people who says "yoga will change your life."
Because it really, really will.

<br><br>Tip: You could book a class, but I\’d recommend YouTube as it\’s less pressure. And just a few feet away from your bed.
<br><br><b>Walking, walking, walking<br><br></b>
The day I swapped my overcrowded, stuffy
commute for a long walk out in the open air, a lot changed for the better. Yes, I finally started hitting my daily step goal. But more importantly, I started clearing those cobwebs and creating some much needed headspace. I\’ve since discovered a study that says an hour of walking can reduce your depression by 26 percent - crazy huh? You have no excuse not to try it now. It\’s also a chance to practice all that mindfulness you\’ve been channeling on the mat as you take in the joy of your surroundings. This morning I noticed the earthy smell that comes after the rain and a dog\’s joy-filled face after finding its new favorite stick. Dreamy.

<br><br>Tip: Change into comfy workout gear before and after work - it makes me much more likely to give the bus a miss!
<br><br><b>Going for a run<br><br></b>
Ever get halfway through the day and find your head feels like it\’s about to explode? Maybe you\’re struggling to balance that post- pandemic social life, or perhaps like me, you\’re always making your way through that never-ending to-do list. Well, let me tell you, going for a run is like one big, giant "restart" button for your soul. I head out any time I\’m feeling overwhelmed and come back feeling brand new. Even a 10-15 minute jog around the block is enough to get those feel-good endorphins flowing. Plus, you can listen to your favorite podcast or album while you\’re at it. Beyoncé anyone?
<br><br><b>Spin for the win<br><br></b>
If the thought of going to a spin class scares you, I totally get it. I was there once too. If I\’m really honest, it still scares me sometimes. But believe me, there is nothing like the mental reset you\’ll get from half an hour of pedalling faster than you thought possible to some bangin\’ tunes. Yes it\’s intense, but the benefits you\’ll feel for days after each session will make how tough it was feel like a distant dream. Do it enough and you\’ll even get to the point where it
becomes … dare I say it, fun. Just thinking
about it makes me want to get my next class booked in. (And that\’s something I never thought I\’d say!)

<br><br>Tip: Book a non-refundable class. It doesn\’t
have to be harsh on your bank account if it
means you definitely go.
<br><br><b>I\’m in no doubt that exercise has helped my mood swings, but what does the expert say? Professor Sarina Schrager, specialist in family medicine and women\’s health, shares the science behind it all. <br><br></b>
"The benefits of exercise are undeniable. Not only does it help you maintain your weight, but studies show it can decrease your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and several different forms of cancer. It also makes you feel fantastic. It\’s thought regular exercise can help treat depression, anxiety, and premenstrual syndrome.

<br><br>When it comes to improving mood, no one is completely sure why exercise works, but
research suggests it could be down to a couple of different factors. Firstly, it can increase your endorphin levels, which are considered the body\’s natural opioids. Ever heard of a \’runner\’s high\’"? This is what that\’s referring to. It can also affect a variety of other substances in your body and decrease inflammation. Studies show that exercise can work to help anxiety, just as well as medications without the side effects!

<br><br>When it comes to the effect of exercise on
premenstrual syndrome specifically, there are multiple studies, mostly examining cardio (running, walking, biking, and swimming) or yoga. While most have shown a benefit, we are still waiting for more studies to confirm this. What is indisputable looking at all the collective research, is that all types of exercise seem to demonstrate benefits to your mood."

    <string name="Beat_the_Bloat_content"><![CDATA[Whether you call it a belly balloon, tummy puff or food baby. We uncover the impact hormones, gut and lifestyle habits can have on your bloat and share simple tips on keeping it under control.]]></string>
    <string name="Why_You_re_Bloated_Cycle_or_Gut">Why You\’re Bloated: Cycle or Gut?</string>
    <string name="Why_You_re_Bloated_Cycle_or_Gut_content"><![CDATA[Ah, bloating - it\’s such a common struggle. Socommon that around one in five women report that they experience it. Of course, hormonal fluctuations could be to blame (thanks, Mother Nature!), but sometimes there are other lifestyle or dietary issues behind it. That\’s why understanding your body, your cycle, and your triggers is so important.

<br><br>To help you out, we played detective and dug into the main causes of bloating to find out how your cycle and hormones or your lifestyle habits can add to that tight belly feeling…
<br><br><b>Gas<br><br></b>
<b>How it manifests: </b> It\’s pretty obvious! But in
case you hadn\’t noticed, it can make your belly feel (and look) like it\’s about to burst, especially when you try to suck it in.

<br><br><b>Cycle triggers: </b> The sex hormones estrogen
and progesterone drop during the late part of the luteal phase (just before your period), and then they drop again when your period starts. This can cause that "bloated feeling"
although it isn\’t clear whether it\’s gas, fluid
retention, or something else that\’s to blame.

<br><br><b>Gut triggers: </b> Foods that cause gas. Known
culprits include some veggies, such as beans, broccoli, onions, cabbage, sprouts, cauliflower, artificial sweeteners (think bubble gum), and soda.

<br><br><b>How to tell one from the other: </b> Track your
cycle and symptoms - it\’ll help you identify when you have hormonal fluctuations that lead to feeling puffy or a bit more gassy
than usual.

<br><br><b>Help yourself: </b> Tracking your food can help you identify possible triggers. If you decide to cut down on food triggers for bloating, remember: a healthy diet still requires fiber so make sure you get at least five servings of fruit/vegetables daily.
<br><br><b>Constipation<br><br></b>
<b>How it manifests: </b> It\’s not just being unable to poo or pooping less often than is normal for you. It can also mean hard, dry, or lumpy stools or stools that are difficult or painful to pass or just a feeling that you haven\’t quite emptied out. And when your stools stay in your body longer than normal, you\’re likely to feel gassy and bloated.

<br><br><b>Cycle triggers: </b> It could be a temporary
constipation rut due to changes in hormones just before menstruation. Things should loosen up when your period begins.

<br><br><b>Gut triggers: </b> There\’s a lot: not enough fiber,
dehydration, not being active enough, ignoring the urge to go, stress, medications … the list goes on.

<br><br><b>How to tell one from the other: </b> If you track
your cycle, you might notice there\’s a specific time you\’re prone to being a bit more backed up than usual. And if it is hormones causing constipation, you know it\’ll only be temporary.

<br><br><b>Help yourself: </b> If your constipation lasts longer, you should see a doctor. Also, try some of these:

<br><br><i>Increase your fiber. </i> Choose whole grain options whenever you can, add legumes like beans, chickpeas, and lentils to stews and salads, and eat more fruit, veggies, nuts, and seeds. But go slowly - adding too much fiber when you are not used to it can actually make bloating and gas worse.

<br><br><i>Drink enough. </i> The healthy recommendation is 6-8 glasses of fluid daily for an adult.

<br><br><i>Move more. </i> The American Heart Association advises 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of intense exercise a week.

<br><br><i>Don\’t hold it in. </i> When you need to go, go. If you don\’t, things could get backed up.

<br><br><i>Check your meds. </i> Constipation is a side effect for some. If it\’s becoming an issue for you, chat with your health care provider about other options.

<br><br><i>Mind your mental health. </i> It\’s not common
knowledge, but mental health can affect bowel habits. If you\’re struggling with any kind of mental health issue, talk with your health care provider as soon as you can.
<br><br><b>Diarrhea<br><br></b>
<b>How it manifests: </b> You\’ll experience much
looser and more frequent stools than is normal for you. Sometimes it almost feels like you\’re passing liquid. And, of course, the gas and discomfort associated with diarrhea can make you feel seriously bloated.

<br><br><b>Cycle triggers: </b> Studies have found that
hormonal fluctuations can cause diarrhea for some people just before their period, while others get it during menstruation

<br><br>There\’s a theory that prostaglandins could be to blame. They\’re a substance produced during periods that cause the muscles and blood vessels of the uterus to contract. But they might have the same effect on your intestines.

<br><br><b>Gut triggers: </b> Some common causes of short-term diarrhea include: viruses, food poisoning, anxiety, food allergies, and too much alcohol. In these cases, diarrhea will usually clear up without treatment after a few days, particularly if it\’s caused by an infection (although some infections can last a week or more).

<br><br>Longer term causes of diarrhea can include
IBS, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and
celiac disease.

<br><br><b>How to tell one from the other: </b> The diarrhea that\’s provoked by hormonal fluctuations would be cyclical. In other words, it happens around the same time each cycle.

<br><br><b>Help yourself: </b> While there\’s not much you can do to stop cycle-related diarrhea, if you\’ve been tracking your cycle and you spot the connection, you\’ll know when it\’s likely to strike so you can try to reduce it.

<br><br>For example, you can try adding more fiber - whole-grain bread, fruits, and vegetables - to
your diet a few days before you expect diarrhea to show up. Fiber makes stool more solid.

<br><br>Remember that if you\’re going through a bout of diarrhea, you\’re losing a lot of fluids. So it\’s really important to drink small, frequent sips of water to stay hydrated.

<br><br>If diarrhea persists or if you have blood in your stool, you should see a doctor.
<br><br><b>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) <br><br><b>
<b>How it manifests: </b> When it comes to gut
discomfort and how the menstrual cycle plays a part, IBS is different from all of the above.

<br><br>The thing is, IBS is a collection of symptoms
like distended belly, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and constipation that come and go and can last from days to months. Most people who have it will have it for life.

<br><br>Frustratingly, the cause of IBS is yet unknown, but it has been linked to food passing through the body too quickly or slowly; an oversensitive gut; stress; genetics, and lifestyle factors.

<br><br>If you have IBS, your menstrual cycle - the plummeting sex hormones during the late-
luteal phase and your period - can trigger a
flare up.

<br><br>To add insult to injury, our hormones also
increase the time it takes food to move through our bodies, increase our stress, and increase sensitivity to pain.

<br><br><b>Help yourself: </b> There\’s no proven cure for IBS. The best way to deal with it is to get to know your body and what it responds to - or
doesn\’t. In short, it\’s all about tracking your
cycle, your stress levels, and your food. That
might sound like a lot of work, but you can do it all in this app, and it will definitely be worth it.

<br><br>And a few more tips on top of that:

<br><br><i>Keep things fresh. </i> Cook homemade food with fresh ingredients

<br><br><i>Lower stress. </i> Try regular mindfulness
meditation, or simply go for a walk - it can do wonders! Research has found a
50-minute stroll in your local green space can ease anxiety and negativity.

<br><br><i>Exercise regularly. </i> It helps things get moving if you\’re constipated, and it can ease bloating and psychological IBS triggers (like stress).

<br><br><i>Try probiotics. </i> Take about a month to see if
they help regulate your gut microbiome.

<br><br><i>Adopt healthy eating habits. </i> Avoid eating too quickly; delaying or skipping meals; and stay away from or limit fatty, spicy, or processed foods, fizzy drinks, and alcohol. Keeping coffee or tea intake to a minimum may help too.

    <string name="_6_Signs_Your_Bloating_Isn_t_PMS">6 Signs Your Bloating Isn\’t PMS</string>
    <string name="_6_Signs_Your_Bloating_Isn_t_PMS_content"><![CDATA[No doubt about it, bloating is often part of the PMS package. But if you\’re dismissing it as "just PMS" every time your stomach balloons, you could be doing yourself a disservice. There are lots of things that can bring on bloating that
a) you could treat so you feel better and
b) really should be checked out by a doctor.

<br><br>So take note of when you\’re bloated, what
you\’ve done that day, and how long the bloating lasts (tip: you can log it and make notes) to build a picture of what\’s really going on. Here are some signs PMS/your cycle may not be behind your bloating ...
<br><br><b>1) You\’ve "always" got a sensitive stomach<br><br></b>
If you\’re regularly dealing with bloating,
cramps, diarrhea, and/or constipation that
comes and goes and doesn\’t seem to sync up with your cycle, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) could be the culprit. IBS is a pretty common digestive condition. But, as the name suggests, it\’s also pretty irritating - IBS flare-ups can last days, weeks, or months.

<br><br>There\’s no test for IBS, but if you think you have it, it\’s a good idea to see a doctor. They can rule out other health issues and - if they think IBS is to blame - give advice on how to
manage it. Turns out everything from dietary
changes, stress reduction, and medication to talk therapy can help.
<br><br><b>2) Bloating stems from food<br><br></b>
Does pizza always = painful bloating? Or a bowl of pasta usually = a balloon belly? If you spot a connection between eating certain foods and bloating - regardless of where you are in your cycle - there\’s a chance you could have a food intolerance.

<br><br>Common culprits? Wheat, gluten, and dairy
and you\’re likely to feel it within a few hours of eating. Suspicious? Try keeping a food/drink diary that tracks what you consume and any symptoms for a couple of weeks. If you spot a pattern, you could try eliminating whatever seems to cause your flare-ups for 2-6 weeks to see if your symptoms improve. (It\’s important to think of it like a science experiment and only eliminate one thing at a time).

<br><br>If it\’s gluten (found in wheat, rye, barley, bread, pasta, cake, beer, etc.) that seems to be the problem, it\’s a good idea to see your doctor. They can check if celiac disease may be to blame. It\’s an autoimmune condition where your body has an adverse reaction to gluten, and if you have it, changing your diet can help you feel way better.

<br><br>If your favorite food is a prime suspect, don\’t get upset at once - it may be that you can eat it, just in smaller amounts. Last but not least: if it turns out you need to cut some things from your diet, it\’s a good idea to talk to a dietician to make sure you\’re getting enough nutrients.
<br><br><b>3) Your periods put life on hold<br><br></b>
If your periods come with not only a heaping
helping of bloating, but also a nightmare combo of pain, feeling sick, constipation/diarrhea, heavy bleeding … oh, and even more pain when you go to the bathroom, it could be a sign of endometriosis.

<br><br>This condition causes tissue that usually grows inside the uterus to grow in other places, such as the ovaries and uterine tubes. Although nobody wants to be diagnosed with endometriosis, it\’s the first step in getting access to a variety of treatments - from medicine to surgery - that can help in a major way.
<br><br><b>4) Your periods are irregular<br><br></b>
We all get period-bombed out of the blue at
some point in life. But consistently irregular
periods are one of the main symptoms of
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that affects how your ovaries work. And research conducted with Northwestern University found that among our users who have PCOS, bloating was their most common symptom (with nearly 40% reporting it).

<br><br>Other symptoms include excessive body and facial hair growth, difficulty getting pregnant, oily skin and acne, weight gain, and hair (on your head) loss.

<br><br>If this sounds all too familiar, speak to your
doctor because the symptoms can be treated if you do have PCOS.
<br><br><b>5) Bloating doesn\’t go away<br><br></b>
If PMS brings on the bloat, it typically eases
when your period arrives and disappears a few days after that. But if being bloated feels like a permanent way of being, it\’s important to get it checked out. Persistent bloating can (and stress can) be a sign of ovarian cancer - along with a constant feeling of fullness; a swollen/uncomfortable tummy; discomfort in your pelvis; feeling full quickly when eating; needing to pee more often; and/or unexplained loss of appetite, fatigue, or change in bowel habits.

<br><br>We know how easy it is to go into panic mode at the thought of cancer, so remember this: cancer is the unlikely diagnosis, especially if you\’re under 50. It\’s just about ruling it out so you can rest easy.
<br><br><b>6) There\’s blood in your BM<br><br></b>
If you see red (or black), take note. This, along with bloating; recurring diarrhea; weight loss; extreme tiredness; fever; and pain, cramps, or swelling in your tummy, can all be signs of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

<br><br>IBD usually refers to two conditions: ulcerative colitis and Crohn\’s disease. Both involve inflammation of the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract, but, frustratingly, the cause isn\’t entirely clear. The good news is that there are various treatments - from lifestyle changes to medicine - that can alleviate the symptoms, so it\’s always worth getting checked out by your doctor. Plus, there are lots of other reasons you might see blood in your bowel movements. It\’s not normally a serious problem, but a checkup is the best way to put your mind at ease.

<br><br>Remember, if your bloating persists - or you
have any other unexplained symptoms - it\’s
always important to seek medical advice to
make sure you\’re in tip-top health.

before you get your period. They\’re caused by hormonal fluctuations.

<br><br>You might feel a sudden urge to eat salty, spicy, or sweet foods. On the one hand, these products will probably satisfy your cravings, but on the other hand, they can cause bloating and problems with digestion

<br><br>- Fatty foods take a long time to digest and can impact the overall digestion process.

<br><br>- Spicy foods cause the stomach to release
excess acid into the esophagus and may lead to heartburn and bloating for some people.

<br><br>- Starchy foods (especially those containing
yeast) begin to actively ferment inside the
intestinal tract, which is accompanied by the creation and expulsion of gas.

<br><br>- Foods high in salt can result in fluid
accumulation in the body, which is why salty
foods can intensify bloating or swelling.
During PMS, it may be helpful to consider the types of foods you eat to reduce the risk of increased gas formation and bloating.

Before Menstruation
<br><br><b>Is this normal? <br><br></b>
A hot flash is like a heatwave starting around the middle of the body or around the neck and suddenly moving up to the face. It occurs suddenly and goes away within 20-30 seconds. Hot flashes are more common among women approaching menopause, but they can also occur in any age group just before the start of menstruation, because they\’re one of the many symptoms of PMS. Just before
menstruation, estrogen levels drop suddenly, which may trigger a hot flash since estrogen influences the brain\’s center of temperature regulation.

<br><br>When a hot flash happens, the body launches its inner mechanisms to compensate for heat loss by sweating.

<br><br>Following these recommendations can help you manage hot flashes:

<br><br>- Avoid hot and stuffy places.

<br><br>- Spend more time in cool environments.

<br><br>- Have a fan to cool you down.

<br><br>- Do not wear synthetic fabrics.

<br><br>- Do light exercises.

<br><br>- Stay well-hydrated.

<br><br>- Eat more vegetables and fruits.

    <string name="An_Increased_Appetite_Before_and_During_Your_Period_content"><![CDATA[Feeling very hungry a few days before or during menstruation is common for many women. This is primarily caused by a change in hormone levels.

<br><br>There are two hormones that influence
appetite: leptin (the higher the level, the fuller you feel) and ghrelin (when it increases, so does your appetite).

<br><br>Sleep quality affects the level of ghrelin. If you don\’t get enough deep sleep (especially in the second phase of the cycle), the ghrelin level rises, and food cravings are more intense than usual.

<br><br>Appetite also depends on the levels of insulin, cortisol, and sex hormones. Low estrogen levels before menstruation can raise the level of ghrelin. They can also lower your mood. Your body may be craving food in order to get more endorphins (happiness hormones) to improve your emotional state.

micronutrients that helps maintain water
balance in the body. You need to consume
about 3.5-4.7 grams of potassium daily for
proper muscle tone, heart rhythm, and
digestion.

<br><br>In the premenstrual phase, the female body
actively produces progesterone, which requires a lot of potassium. This may result in a potassium-sodium imbalance. To prevent it, 10-14 days before your period comes, add foods rich in potassium to your diet: avocados, citrus fruits, bananas, potatoes, salmon, chicken, and dried fruits.

<br><br>If you take diuretics or feel weak during PMS, consult a doctor to find out if you may need potassium supplements. If you start taking supplements, remember that it is important to do so consistently, as taking them intermittently will significantly reduce their efficacy.

<br><br>But hormonal fluctuations are not the only
factor that contributes to PMS symptoms. PMS is also often associated with changes in brain chemicals, and symptoms worsen because of stress, psychological state, poor health, unhealthy nutrition, and certain nutrient deficits. Excess weight and smoking also increase the risk of PMS.

<br><br>There are foods and beverages that can
aggravate PMS symptoms. These are:

<br><br>- Caffeinated beverages: coffee, black tea,
fizzy drinks, and energy drinks.

<br><br>- Salty foods: chips, canned food, crackers,

    <string name="How_Hormones_Can_Impact_Exercise_content"><![CDATA[When it comes to getting physical, we\’re all
about smart fitness. It\’s not that traditional
exercise doesn\’t have its own merits - like
boosting physical health, mood, and sleep
but if we can get these benefits in the most
efficient, effective, and, frankly, easiest way
possible, then we\’re all for it.

<br><br>Which is why factoring your cycle into your
exercise should go beyond whether you need to pack an extra pad in your gym bag.

<br><br>As Dr. Jacky Forsyth, Associate Professor of
Exercise Physiology at Staffordshire University, explains, the differing levels of hormones released into our bodies during the four stages of the menstrual cycle - menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, and luteal.
- can impact everything from energy to strength, stamina, and motivation. Which could explain why some days you practically leap into your gym clothes, and other times it takes two hours to convince yourself to put your shoes on:

<br><br>"Over the course of your cycle, levels of
estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone
fluctuate, triggering a range of physical and
emotional responses that can impact your
motivation and ability to exercise."

<br><br>Of course, as with everything else about our
bodies, there is no one size fits all approach.
"While this information is a useful starting
point, it\’s also about tracking your feelings,
mood, and any symptoms, especially before
and after exercise, as well as how your session went."

<br><br>"Everyone is different, so although the research supports broad findings, these will differ from person to person, and you\’ll also find your own cycle varies from month to month. Everything from diet to exercise to stress can have an impact, as your body will respond to these changes and adapt hormone levels accordingly."

<br><br>Solution? Track these (you can use your Flo
app!), so you can build up a picture of your
cycle and tailor your training accordingly.

    <string name="Menstruation_Keep_It_Low_Key">Menstruation: Keep It Low Key</string>
    <string name="Menstruation_Keep_It_Low_Key_content"><![CDATA[You\’ve got your period, you\’re bleeding, and
you may be experiencing cramps, bloating, and breast, hip, and lower back pain. So you might not exactly feel like cartwheeling in
a pair of hot pants, regardless of what the commercials suggest.

<br><br>"Hormonally, your progesterone and estrogen levels are really low, so you may feel like you have less energy compared to other points in the month," explains
Dr. Jacky Forsyth, Associate Professor of Exercise Physiology at Staffordshire University. "This, combined with the pain and discomfort, may make you feel less motivated to exercise."
<br><br><b>The exercise effect: <br><br></b>
It\’s not that you can\’t exercise; it\’s just that you may not feel like doing it, due to pain, bleeding, and fatigue. So just do you.

<br><br>Jacky notes: "While exercise can alleviate period pain for some, for others it can
aggravate it. It\’s really individual, so listen to
your body, and consider taking time out or a
more moderate approach, particularly in the
first few days. That said, for people who
experience lighter periods, exercise may help with mood and relaxation. Also, your estrogen levels will slowly increase, so from days three to five, you may find energy and motivation rise."
<br><br><b>Work with it

<br><br>Up your zen<br><br></b>
Given the stress your body is under, this can be an excellent time to practice some more holistic fitness, as yoga instructor Jessie Mahoney, M.D., explains.

<br><br>"Yoga has so many relevant benefits, from
alleviating pain and tension, to managing stress and boosting energy. At this time, I would recommend yin or restorative yoga, which practice breathing techniques and build self-compassion. Child\’s pose, reclined spinal twist, and cat-cow poses can help relieve tension in your lower back and pelvis. Seated cat-cow and pigeon pose are good for hip releasing, while forward folds
seated or standing - also help your lower back.

<br><br>To do seated cat-cow, sit on a chair with your feet hip-width apart and your hands on your knees.

<br><br>Inhale: cow pose, leaning forward and
lengthening your body, lifting your chin and
chest, and gazing up.

<br><br>Then exhale: cat pose, leaning back and
rounding through your spine, tucking your chin, and releasing through your neck.
<br><br><b>Walk it out<br><br></b>
Personal trainer Lorena Savvidou, from Girl Can Do, also suggests a low-key approach.

<br><br>"Gentle exercise can help, as it causes your
brain to release endorphins, which act as
analgesics and diminish the perception of pain. Exercise also boosts circulation. When the wall of the uterus contracts, it temporarily cuts off the blood and oxygen flow to your womb, causing it to release chemicals that trigger pain. Exercise works by improving blood flow at the pelvic level."

<br><br>"Walking is non-strenuous and aerobic, so it
can alleviate fatigue and boost mood. If you feel up to it, add some light jogging intervals - say one minute of jogging to seven minutes walking."
<br><br><b>Work your pelvic floor<br><br></b>
Light strengthening exercises are another great option. "Kegel exercises used to strengthen the pelvic floor - may help reduce period pain by increasing the local blood supply, potentially decreasing the duration and intensity of menstrual pain" says Lorena.

<br><br>To do these, squeeze the muscles as if you\’re trying to stop the flow of urine. This contraction pulls the vagina and rectum up and back. You can start with short squeezes, holding for a second or two at a time, building up to three seconds. When you can manage that - hold for three seconds, then relax for three seconds. Do ten three-second contractions three times a
day. Increase your hold by one second each
week, working your way up to 10-second holds.

<br><br>"Another light exercise that has been shown to strengthen the pelvic floor is glute bridges, which activate both your glutes and your pelvic floor" Lorena adds. "Lie face up on the floor, with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Keep your arms at your side, palms down. Lift your hips off the ground until your knees, hips, and shoulders form a straight line, and hold for a couple of seconds, then release and repeat."
<br><br><b>What not to do: <br><br></b>
Although everyone is different, some research suggests that intense exercise, such as running, that causes dehydration or a lack of electrolytes can trigger menstrual cramping.

<br><br>Jessie also suggests adopting a more low-key approach when you\’re on the yoga mat. "Avoid high-energy poses like inversions (poses that place your head below your heart and hips) during this phase. I focus on seated and tabletop postures like gate pose and thread the needle."

    <string name="Follicular_Phase_Up_the_Intensity">Follicular Phase: Up the Intensity</string>
    <string name="Follicular_Phase_Up_the_Intensity_content"><![CDATA[This phase starts on the first day of your
period, so it overlaps with the menstrual phase. "The hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)," explains Dr. Jacky Forsyth, Associate Professor of Exercise Physiology at Staffordshire University.

<br><br>"Your ovaries then produce sacs called follicles, each containing an egg, one of which matures and is released when you ovulate. This triggers a gradual rise in estrogen - associated with elevated energy - and increased serotonin, which stabilizes mood."
<br><br><b>The exercise effect: <br><br></b>
This slow rise in estrogen, combined with the end of your period, means that you\’ll probably feel more able and motivated to exercise. Notes Jacky: "Everything is quite stable, you\’ll be over the cramps, breast pain, and bloating; your temperature, heart, and breathing rate response to exercise are normal; your mood is level. So while you might not pull out a personal best, you can get back to your normal routine."
<br><br><b>Work with it

<br><br>Hit the HIIT<br><br></b>
"Channel your increased energy into some
more high intensity, anaerobic exercise, like
HIIT classes, sprint intervals, and weight
training," says personal trainer Lorena Savvidou, from Girl Can Do.

<br><br>"You\’ll be feeling physically comfortable, and if you\’ve had some time off, chances are you\’re feeling motivated to get back on track. HIIT is a great option in this "catching up phase; because it blends cardio, strength training, and plyometrics into one workout. If you enjoy running, give this a high-intensity spin with sprint interval training. Sprint for 30 seconds at full intensity, do active recovery such as walking for two minutes, then sprint again, four to six times."
<br><br><b>Do a weighted workout<br><br></b>
Here\’s a routine you can try, whether you\’re at home or at the gym: inclined mountain
climbers, jumping jacks, then high knees. To
max it, add ankle weights to the mountain
climbers, do burpees with an overhead
dumbbell lift, or try squat jumps with a
resistance band around your knees.

<br><br>Alternatively, make it easier with squat slides (do a side squat, hold the position for a few seconds, then slide into a squat on the other side), low impact jumping jacks, and high knee marching. Warm up for two to five minutes, then do 40 seconds of work, 20 seconds of rest, repeating each exercise for three rounds. Stretch for two to five minutes.

<br><br>For more of a holistic boost, yoga instructor
Jessie Mahoney, MD, suggests building in some yoga flows that require more energy.
"Keep it simple but effective with sun salutations there are lots of variations. Or try a more dynamic class, like a paced vinyasa flow."
<br><br><b>What not to do: <br><br></b>
Your energy levels are rising during this phase, so there aren\’t really any limits on exercise. However, if you\’re hoping to set a personal best or compete in optimum conditions, that might be easier later in your cycle.
<br><br><b>What not to do: <br><br></b>
Although everyone is different, some research suggests that intense exercise, such as running, that causes dehydration or a lack of electrolytes can trigger menstrual cramping.

<br><br>Jessie also suggests adopting a more low-key approach when you\’re on the yoga mat. "Avoid high-energy poses like inversions (poses that place your head below your heart and hips) during this phase. I focus on seated and tabletop postures like gate pose and thread the needle."

    <string name="Ovulation_Pull_a_Personal_Best">Ovulation: Pull a Personal Best</string>
    <string name="Ovulation_Pull_a_Personal_Best_content"><![CDATA["During this phase, your estrogen levels are
high, and you\’ll have increased levels of
luteinizing hormone (LH)," says Dr. Jacky
Forsyth, Associate Professor of Exercise
Physiology at Staffordshire University. "This
triggers the body to start ovulating."

<br><br>"In terms of exercise, it\’s the estrogen that has the most impact, giving additional energy, boosting mood, and having a steroid effect. So you could feel stronger or find you\’re better able to build muscle during this phase. Testosterone levels are at their highest during the latter part of this stage, which can make you more daring and competitive. But progesterone levels remain stable and low, so temperature, heart rate, and breathing rate are even."
<br><br><b>The exercise effect: <br><br></b>
"When your estrogen levels are high, your body tends to conserve glycogen stores
(carbohydrates) and have an increased ability to burn fat" says Jacky.

<br><br>"This is important in exercise terms, because carbohydrate fuel supplies are very limited in the body. So their depletion is a major cause of fatigue during prolonged exercise. By being able to rely on your fat reserves, you may feel more comfortable during sustained periods of exercise. Feelings of fatigue will be delayed, so
you\’ll be able to train for longer periods. Plus, elevated estrogen levels have also been shown to delay the onset of muscle soreness, so you may find recovery easier."
<br><br><b>Work with it

<br><br>Push for a personal best<br><br></b>
If you\’re a competitive athlete on any level
(even if it\’s just in your own mind), this is the
time to aim for personal bests.

<br><br>"This phase is great for endurance activity,"
says personal trainer Lorena Savvidou, from Girl Can Do. "So if you\’re a runner, up your distance and enter some races. If you love cycling, sign up for a major ride. If you\’re a swimmer, max your lengths."
<br><br><b>Combine cardio and strength<br><br></b>
"You can also harness your increased ability in terms of weight-based training via circuit
classes that blend cardio with dumbbells,
medicine balls, and kettlebells, or group fitness classes that use barbells," says Lorena.

<br><br>Alternatively, channel it into this routine: plank shoulder taps, pop squats, and star jumps will test stamina, while deadlifts, push-ups, and assisted chin-ups test strength.

<br><br>To max this, add chair tricep dips, single leg
bridges and side plank hip lifts. Or for gentler options, swap in standing leg extensions, back leg raises, lateral or forward arm raises, and knee-to-chest lifts. Again, warm up for two to five minutes, then do 40 seconds of work, 20 seconds of rest, repeating each exercise for three rounds. Stretch for two to five minutes.
<br><br><b>Do dynamic yoga<br><br></b>
This is a great time to level up your yoga
practice by trying more dynamic classes and trying new poses.

<br><br>"Holding challenging postures can develop
physical and mental toughness and endurance. Tree pose and dancer pose test stamina, while longer warrior poses and goddess pose test strength," says yoga instructor Jessie Mahoney, M.D. "Opt for vinyasa flow or faster paced, heated yoga classes."
<br><br><b>What not to do: <br><br></b>
Although your energy and strength may be
peaking, you need to watch out for
hyperextending your joints.

<br><br>"With higher levels of estrogen, your joints are more pliant and less stable. So you\’re more at risk of injury - particularly ligament injuries especially with twisting sports like football or basketball. A safer option is linear strength training (doing reps while slowly increasing the weight of your barbells) because it\’s more
controlled."

    <string name="Luteal_Phase_Go_for_Moderate_Exercise">Luteal Phase: Go for Moderate Exercise</string>
    <string name="Luteal_Phase_Go_for_Moderate_Exercise_content"><![CDATA[There\’s a dip in estrogen just before and after ovulation, with estrogen rising again mid-luteal phase, about a week after ovulation. However, during this phase progesterone levels also increase. Depending on the balance between these two hormones, this may trigger physical
responses that can affect exercise
performance.

<br><br>"Progesterone is produced by the corpus
luteum," says Dr. Jacky Forsyth, Associate
Professor of Exercise Physiology at
Staffordshire University. "This is the area on the ovary created by the collapsed follicle that released the ovulated egg. Levels of
progesterone - associated with elevated
temperature, heart rate, and tiredness
peak in the middle of this phase. If conception doesn\’t occur, the corpus luteum starts to break down nine to ten days after ovulation. This causes progesterone and estrogen levels to fall and triggers your period."
<br><br><b>The exercise effect: <br><br></b>
Roughly a week after you ovulate, increasing
progesterone raises your core body
temperature and heart rate. This means that
endurance-based training such as running or cycling may seem harder, and you might
experience fatigue sooner, particularly if you\’re training in hot temperatures.

<br><br>You may also feel more drowsy, which could
affect your motivation to exercise. Then, about 10 to 12 days after ovulation, or two to three days before your period starts, progesterone falls. This can cause side effects like breast pain, bloating, low mood, and anxiety - all of which can make exercise more challenging.
<br><br><b>Work with it

<br><br>Go with the flow<br><br></b>
"Moderate exercise that keeps endorphin levels up and stress levels down is good - jogging and dance fitness classes are good options," says personal trainer Lorena Savvidou, from Girl Can Do.
<br><br><b>Do some slow yoga<br><br></b>
If you\’re experiencing stress or anxiety, yoga is a great exercise option.

<br><br>"Because it is a controlled, mindful practice,
yoga helps us feel balanced, grounded, and
centered, all of which is helpful in responding to hormonal shifts," says yoga instructor Jessie Mahoney, M.D. "It nourishes the body and mind, and it\’s an effective tool for managing stress and pain. Restorative, yin, hatha, and mindful yoga classes are good options at this time."
<br><br><b>What not to do: <br><br></b>
With progesterone fluctuating, you may find
endurance exercise tougher during this phase. So if you want to stick with it, just be mindful of these hormonal effects.

<br><br>"It\’s not that you can\’t do it, you just might find it more difficult and need to hydrate more, says Jacky. "Also, if you do heart rate training where you train at a specific percentage of your maximum heart rate - bear in mind that it may be a little higher around this time."

    <string name="Hormones_Can_Affect_Your_Appetite_content"><![CDATA[Hormones control many processes in our body, including appetite.

<br><br>Leptin, "the hormone of energy expenditure," is found in fat tissue and is responsible for hunger reduction. It signals to the brain that the body has enough nutrients. The more fat tissue you have, the more leptin is released. Since it is produced while you are sleeping, the lack of sleep lowers the level of leptin. This explains why you may feel more hungry after a poor night\’s sleep.

<br><br>On the other hand, ghrelin, "the hunger
hormone" makes your appetite run wild. It is
released in the stomach and gives the brain the signal: "Famine!" Your level of ghrelin
determines how soon you will want to eat again after having a meal. During sleep, ghrelin levels decrease. Ghrelin levels naturally rise and decrease every four hours, which is why eating regularly can help promote healthy levels of the hormone.

<br><br>Studies have shown that a diet high in complex carbohydrates and protein, as well as a sufficient amount of sleep at night, helps your body balance these hormones and avoid uncontrolled hunger pangs.

    <string name="Managing_Hunger_While_on_Your_Period_content"><![CDATA[If your hunger increases during your period, be sure to consume foods that promote satiety or a sense of fullness, such as foods rich in fiber, protein, and healthy fats. Fiber can be found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Sources of lean protein include eggs, low-fat yogurt or cottage cheese, poultry (chicken/turkey), and fish. Healthy fats are unsaturated fats, found,
for example, in nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil. Fruit with yogurt and nuts is an example of a balanced snack that includes fiber, protein, and fat.

<br><br>You might feel extra-hungry on your period
because your body is trying to increase its
serotonin. You can offer your body another way to raise the level of serotonin (walking,
swimming, or doing your favorite things)
instead.

<br><br>And if you do eat much more than usual, it\’s
alright. When your period ends, your hunger
level will probably go back to normal.

It\’s a mainly clear or white discharge that can leave a stain or dry onto your underwear. Cervical mucus keeps the vagina moist, which can make sexual intercourse easier. It also helps prevent infections.

<br><br>The nature and amount of cervical mucus
change throughout the menstrual cycle. A few days before ovulation, cervical mucus usually resembles egg whites: it is thin, clear, and stretchy. This feature of cervical mucus is good for sperm movement through the cervical canal, after which they journey to the uterine tubes to fertilize the egg. After ovulation, the amount of cervical mucus gradually decreases.

<br><br>The texture of cervical mucus depends on
many factors, such as stress, using soap or
lubricants, being underweight, and following a diet that can reduce the amount of cervical mucus released.

<br><br>One easy way to improve cervical mucus is to drink enough water. The more liquid your body receives, the easier sperm can move through the cervical mucus. To maintain a healthy water balance, you should drink about 8 glasses of clean water daily.

<br><br>Drinking too little water may decrease the
production of cervical mucus and lessen its
quality, which can adversely affect your ability to conceive.
